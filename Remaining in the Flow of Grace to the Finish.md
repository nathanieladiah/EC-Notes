# The Highway and The River

We know that the highway is taking us to the end of time.
You can't have a journey to the finish through a difficult terrain in order to allow a lot of people to navigate through it at once.

The river is a powerful source of life in the wilderness.
Part of the intent of God is that stuff comes out of us that affects and brings life to others.
* Psalms 84:5-7
