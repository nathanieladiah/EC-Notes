# The Highway to Zion
Sunday 14th July 2024

[[DNW]]
[[Moving Forward from Knock 6]]

It requires close individual consideration and application. We understand that our individual walk to Maturity  contributes to the corporate whole.

Knock #6 released a huge alert through the Congress that the saints as a whole have arrived at an acceptable and appropriate Maturity before the Lord!

The  saints should be taking hold of it and running with it.
Then move to a focus of ingathering.

## The 8 Lanes:

1. [[Stand in the Place Where God is]]!
2. [[Sustain Our Oneness & Synchronization!]]
3. [[Carry the whole Body of Christ in Your Heart!]]
4. [[Have a Mature Response to the Time of Judgment!]]
5. [[Be Confident in Hearing the Voice of God]]
6. [[Be Refreshed and Renewed for a New Thrust!]]
7. [[Enter the Power of Finalized Maturity]]!
8. [[Embrace the Potential for Acceleration]]!

### Stand in the Place where God is!

The characteristics of the Upper Realm must become increasingly manifest in the conduct of our lives. Requires adjustment to our personal conduct and culture.

Responsibility becomes a key word for us now.
Every saint must take on the responsibility.

There must be total community effort to regulate all areas of our life together
We need to live in a state of peace and company. Friendships, relationships filled with light.

No distortion or discord between us.

### Sustain our Oneness & Synchronization

Oneness is something that the powers of darkness will be attacking with full force! So we commit ourselves to vigorously defending against all divisive factors from within our hearts.

The enemy's aim is to destroy that oneness. We must refuse brokenness and discord.

Choosing to be mature in our response to others demonstrates our love for the person and for the Lord.

### Carry the Body of Christ in your Heart

The Body of Christ: our spiritual forefathers who served before us and have been elevated to the Upper Realm + all those who serve Christ from their hearts today as we move towards the Finish.

Our order of life goes beyond the immediate things.
This expands us beyond the limitation of our own circumstances.

### A Mature Response to the Time of Judgment

Judgment correctly received is the mercy of God. It is not designed for destruction.
- Produces purification, separation and liberation.
* For us removes that which is bad so that which is good shines more brightly.

Represents a season of intimacy and enhanced partnership with the Lord.

We are already approved because we are "in Christ"

### Be confident in Hearing the Voice of God

Our journey began from hearing His voice.

In the days of the End we literally live by the constant hearing of guidance from the Lord.

The sheep hear His voice; He calls His sheep **BY NAME**; they follow because they know His voice.
* The power to follow shows prophetic ability.

Each saint of the Congress can request this prophetic impartation.

Our long journey was filled with the Voice of God
God is faithful to guide to the very End

### Be Refreshed and Renewed for a New Thrust

Strip off anything that slows us down or holds us back.

K#6 released a new thrust and capacity to complete the corporate mission.

Renew the commitment to keep the standard of the Lord
Be filled with Hope and Expectation for HIs coming in the dullness and darkness of the current day.

### Enter the Power of Finalised Maturity

Maturity is the Capacity to Sustain our movement to the destination ordained by God.

Create a Clear Separation between the spiritual structure that you are and the contamination of the world.

Diligently seek Knowledge and Understanding. Listen and Obey carefully
Be watchful! Be unshakable! Stand Your Ground!
Appropriately boldfaced.

### Embrace the Potential for Acceleration!

Stay on the Highway! Continue in the Ways! Produce spiritual fruit! Remain relevant to the Lord!

Embrace the potential of the Future! Continue to Look Forward! 

Be on your guard! Do not let Time delete you! Have a conquering spirit!
