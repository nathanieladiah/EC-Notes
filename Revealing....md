The Highway **IS** Christ Himself!
- There are no exit ramps, the highway has only one direction and destination, the End.
* He is the single pattern for us. He walked in the earth and among us, felt what we felt. He knows what it feels like.


Opening Statements
* To walk the highway to Zion is to be brought into an intense focus upon the presence and the person of Jesus Christ.
	* I want this
* To walk the Highway to Zion is to enter into a season of 'spiritual richness' in which the patterns that flow from the life of Jesus are built strongly inside of you.
	* A day of poverty in the hearts of men across the earth, but in our world, there must be spiritual richness.
* To walk the Highway to Zion is to experience a "departing from" and also an 'approaching to' as a valid observable spiritual experience taking place within you
	* Philippians 3:7 NLT - I once thought these things were valuable, but now I consider them worthless because of what Christ has done.
* To walk the Highway to Zion is to experience the life-altering realization of the non-negotiable reality of 'community'.
	* Psalms 35:18 NIV I will give you thanks in the great assembly; among the throngs I will praise you.
	* Psalms 34:18 AMP - I will give You thanks in the great assembly; I will praise You among a mighty throng.

The great highway march towards Christ concludes with the reality that we will be actually with Him forever.

It's a journey of knowledge towards maturity.

Ephesians 4:13-15 NIV - 

"We will grow to become **IN EVERY RESPECT** the mature body of Christ"
* How does this manifest in our determination to build a mature Community?

John 14:2-6

* My Father's House: oikia: singleness of a dwelling place; that which belongs to;
* Many rooms: mansions: extensive levels of existence; expansive and complex
* Prepare a place: a place made ready that is particular to the one who is coming; also incorporates the way that is made that leads to that place.
* We are in the midst of an intense phase of preparation that is in the very last stages
	* Jesus is in the Upper Realm preparing the place specifically for a finalized Church
	* But on the earth the spirit and power of Elijah that resonated earlier in John the Baptist urges us into final preparation also
		* Matthew 3:3 - "Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him."

* "...we don't know where you are going ... Jesus answered, "I am the way":
	* You cannot find it by knowing the location and direction
	* The navigation to that place is to be discovered in the discovery of a life.
	* Jesus IS the Hodos - He is the Highway! He is the path to the heavenly destination
