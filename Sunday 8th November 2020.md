#ECCG

1.  Is the lifestyle you practice manifestly different from the proclaimed standards?
2. Is there a gap between your proclamation of the faith and the lifestyle you manifest to friends and family?
3. Are you engaged in any activity or behaviour that you know in your heart is not correct and not appropriate to where the Lord has placed us?
4. Is your current lifestyle and life-standards not in keeping with the first fire of the faith that entered your heart? Has the fire died?
5. Have you by your actions or behaviours caused the dying of that first hope and that freshness of salvation in the hearts of others?

# Increasing importance of the saints
**Marlon**

Numbers 22:4-6
> 4 The king of Moab said to the elders of Midian, “This mob will devour everything in sight, like an ox devours grass in the field!”
> 
> So Balak, king of Moab, 5 sent messengers to call Balaam son of Beor, who was living in his native land of Pethor near the Euphrates River. His message said:
> 
> “Look, a vast horde of people has arrived from Egypt. They cover the face of the earth and are threatening me. 6 Please come and curse these people for me because they are too powerful for me. Then perhaps I will be able to conquer them and drive them from the land. I know that blessings fall on any people you bless, and curses fall on people you curse.”

Numbers 24

God is focused on the positioning of the heads of the households.
This is what the Lord was holding in high esteem when He frustrated the secret attacks of the enemy.

It is the life of ordinary saints.


Numbers 31:16
> 16 “These are the very ones who followed Balaam’s advice and caused the people of Israel to rebel against the Lord at Mount Peor. They are the ones who caused the plague to strike the Lord’s people.

* Corruption of the homes was the advice given to bring down God's people. If the core shatters, the movement of God will be severely compromised.

Releasing 2 things:

* Into the Congress and the Core
* Massive resource and massive responsibility


# Becoming a Mature Church
**Farid**

KNOCK#1 was not just simply an event, but represented a transiton.

A biblical pattern - conquering the promised land

4 Maturity principles

## 1: A final and deliberate cutting off of the past

Joshua - Moses is dead... Now... arise...

1 Corinthians 13:11
> 11 When I was a child, I spoke and thought and reasoned as a child. But when I grew up, I put away childish things.

## 2: A season when everyone carries load, must take responsibility.
Joshua 6 - battle not fought by the army only; but every single person.

Joshua 6:5
> 5 When you hear the priests give one long blast on the rams’ horns, have all the people shout as loud as they can. Then the walls of the town will collapse, and the people can charge straight into the town.”

## 3: Have courage and strength

Courage implies in spite of fear, doubt and anxiety one adopts an internal posoture of faith and determination.

## 4: Season of careful and deliberate advance

Deuteronomy 7:22
> 22 The Lord your God will drive those nations out ahead of you little by little. You will not clear them away all at once, otherwise the wild animals would multiply too quickly for you.
