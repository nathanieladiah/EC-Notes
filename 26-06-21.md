## Jesus our Pattern for Word Based Living

> Jesus is our pattern for maturity, for development, and for living life.
>       - DNW

In Matthew 3:16-4:11, Jesus is leb by God through a time of testing of His character, that created an internal default decision making process that always started with the Word of God.
* the word of God clothed Him  
it was part of his dna and the foundation of who he was
* He had a bank of significant knowledge of the Word that was an amalgamation of impartation, pursuit, routine and practice


Reflection:

1. Consider and record strategies that you will use to develop/build/strengthen your pursuit of knowledge of the word of God.
    I choose an activity to priortize everyday. Just writing it down and actively saying I'm going to do this thing today, makes it likely that I'll do it. Schedule it.


2. Think of ways to develop a personal culture of reflexively referencing the Word in order to shape responses and reactions.
    Keep a journal. At night I spend time going over my day and check how i responded and acted to certain things. Then I could have a concrete idea of my current state. Then I can go over notes or the word to get a Word based acceptable response.

3. What is required for you to stand in a posture of inquirey to be guided by the Holy Spirit into relevant application of the Word to your circumstances?


#### Practical considerations: Making the Word Core to Life

The Word has to become core to our lives and this will require deliberate decisions, actions, discipline and diligence. Key activities:
* Reading the word of God
* Prayer
* Worship 
* Message Review
* Meditation 
* Interactions
* Internal Dialogue
* Listening
* Situational Inquiry
* Application

#### Practical Tips - Developing a Rhythm for interaction with the Word of God:

1. It's important that you find a shape and rhythm that fits into the architecture of your life. Be realistic and make a routine that is _'easy'_ to commit to, sustainable and flexible.

2. Calibrate the structure by knowledge of yourself and your personal limitations and also by what god wants for you now.

3. Let the cry and desperation for a new relationship with the word of God be the underlayer of your rhythm.


The word is life: flow of sustaining life that operates independently of the state of the earth.
2 Timothy 2:15
- Correct attitude.
    correct handling the word of truth. How we need to be in 2021. Acts 17:11
        more noble character - because they examined the scriptures everyday. And eagerly received the word and check against the scriptures for yourself.

2 Timothy 3:14-17
- The word corrects, but also teaches us what is right.

James 1:22-25
- No residual impact if you don't do what the word says. Need to look closely at the word, investigate and compare with the state of your life and do what it says.


#### Defining life principles in the midst of the crisis

* The reality of increase

    As functional individuals, I'm not sure what this means. What is increase for me? 
    A sense of peace/calm?
    
    


* what is the upper realm and how to capture and make the upper realm our source of strength


#### complex community 

* implication in personal life
