# Faith in the Season of the Finish

Faith: 
    - refers to the truth that we believe in

Romans 4:20
    - God wants us to strengthen our faith, so we can please God and work with Him.

The big pattern of finishing is Israel crossing the Jordan

Joshua 1:1-9

A company of people who have been on a long and arduous journey have at last come to the border of entering into the finish.

Faith for
a.
b. Continuous victory from now until completion
c. The permanent presence of the Lord


Actions of faith:
a. Recognize the time
b. Be strong and courageous.
c. Be careful to obey all instructions.

Reminder: "Walk carefully and I will Guide you!"

We Need Faith to Overcome Obstacles

Joshua 3:14-17
    - Consider that God did not need to bring them to the river at all, they could have walked around
Crossing required:
    - exact obedience
    - faith 
    - a miracle - the miracle was the timing

God wanted a long term result

Joshua 5:1

Hebrews 11: Different examples but all are of faith

Joshua 2


Rahab's Faith caused the Lord to make an exception to his command to destroy all the people of Jericho

James 2:25 - Rahab's faith is mentioned as being righteous in the same way as Abraham
Matthew 1:5 - She was grafted into the people of God and became part of the ancestry of Christ
