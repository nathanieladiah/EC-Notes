[[Highway to the Finish]]

Isaiah 35:8-10
8. And a highway will be there; it will be called the Way of Holiness; it will be for those who walk on that Way. The unclean will not journey on it; wicked fools will not go about on it.
10. and those the Lord has rescued will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away

Isaiah 35: 1-8 NIV

What are the internal realities that capture abundant faith rising up.

## Four Aspects of Renewal and Refreshing

### A Renewal of Strength

Isaiah 35:3 NLT
> strengthen those who have tired hands, and encourage those who have weak knees.

Many have been on this journey for a long time. The law of entropy - everything is moving towards decay.

The reality of time and mortality is that it is a  slow process of deterioration that can wear you out.
God is encouraging us to not be defeated by time but draw strength from the sight of the Upper Realm drawing close.

Hebrews 10:36-37
> You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised. 
> For, "In just a little while, he who is coming will come and will not delay."

It is important that we recognize the intent of darkness

Matthew 24:12 NIV

Galatians 6:9
> So let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up

Now is not a time to give up (to loose)

Luke 22:41-43
> He walked away, about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed,
> "Father, if you are willing, please take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet I want your will to be done, not mine."
> Then an angel from heaven appeared and strengthened him.

The Highway is therefore finishing strength and capacity for the last leg of the journey ahead.

### A Renewal of our Mind & Emotions

Isaiah 35:4 NKJV
> Say to those who are fearful-hearted, "Be strong, do not fear! Behold, your God will come with vengeance, With the recompense of God; He will come and save you."


We must consciously reject the pervading sense of hopeless, despair and fear associated with a dying planet.
This must be replaced with increasing faith in the supernatural provision and protection of our God.

Psalms 24:4 NKJ
> Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; For You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.

The key imagery in Psalms 24 is the shepherd.

#### A Focus on the Shepherd

Rod - used to fight off wild animals; also used to count the sheep.

Staff - used to rescue the sheep and guide them.

We must actively comprehend both the heart of the shepherd and the power and authority of the shepherd.
- Remember the UDR
* 1 Samuel 17:34-35

The Highway is therefore access to and active guidance by our Father in Heaven who will lead us on the correct pathway.

### A Renewal of Sight

Isaiah 35:5
> Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped.

There is a dimension of blindness that is less about a lack of capacity to see and more the result of where we focus our gaze - on the affairs of life.
When we move beyond that God allows another reality to appear before us.

Genesis 21:14-19 NIV

* Was the well of water always there?
* Did Hagar's pain, grief and fear prevent her from discerning the provision of the Lord?

Often the biggest hindrance to sight is domination by the self-life.
- Genesis 13:10
>   And Lot lifted his eyes and saw all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere (before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah) like the garden of the lord, 


What do we intuitively attend to?

Proverbs 4:20
> My son give attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings.

In this season we are asking God to consciously align our desires with His desires.

John 7:17 NKJV
> If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority.

The highway is an opening of the eyes and new alignment of the heart with the heart of God.


### Birthing of New Productivity

Isaiah 35:6-7

These verses describe areas of our life that have been historically barren and unproductive.
There is a clear message here, when God is ready, he has the capacity to rapidly turn around circumstances.

#### Reminders
1. Be delivered from the burden of memory and past mistakes
	*  Isaiah 43:18 - Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past.
	*  Philippians 3:13 ... but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead
2. Reject wrong attitudes and behaviours and allow the evaluation of God to create a clear path forward.
		Isaiah 40:3-4
	>  The voice of one crying in the wilderness: "Prepare the way of the Lord; Make straight in the desert. A highway for our God."
> 	 Every valley shall be exalted, And every mountain and hill brought low; The crooked places shall be made straight And the rough places smooth;
3. Walk in the New!
	*  2 Corinthians 5:17 
	*  Discussion of new theory of genetics and evolution

The highway is a departure from former crooked places and entry into a clear track of development.
