[[PrayerPoint]]
The Upper Realm is getting closer and closer, so it should be more imperative in my life. It should govern my life more.

Ephesians 1:19-23

Because of all of this, we should strive to be "like Christ" in all things
We must have rich responses in our own hearts, a personal transformation and journey.

John 6:38-44 NIV
> 38 For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.
> 39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.
> 40 For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day."
> 41 At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."
> 42 They said, "Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came down from  heaven'?"
> 43 "Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered.
> 44 "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day."


I need to realize that I have come to do God's will. My wants need to take a backseat to the purposes of God.

Cannot let my self drives to dominate the atmospherics.

**prayer** - Be like Christ - an image of Christ

We can ask God to teach us to discover how Philippians 2:5-8 can be applied in my life.
Sit before God, read a bit and weep before Him.
How do I shatter the self wants.


Balance between practicality and spirituality.
