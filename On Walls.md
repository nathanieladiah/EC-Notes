Proverbs 25:28

NKJ
> Whoever has no rule over his own spirit is like a city broken down, without walls

NLT
> A person without self-control is like a city with broken-down walls.

Management of our own spirit to maintain our walls. Self control/governance.

Isaiah 26:1-5 NIV
> In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city
> 3 You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they truest in you. 4. Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord, the Lord himself, is the Rock eternal

There's a strong link between our worship and the strengthening of our spiritual walls.
Allows light to flood into our hearts and dispel the darkness.

We can face challenges in life that can give us frustration or tire us. We must continually open our hearts to Him and allow his light to flood into our hearts.
It is even more important to give our hearts to him in a time when there is attack from the enemy.

Psalms 9:1-11 NLT
