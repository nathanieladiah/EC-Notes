> There can be no Representation without Maturity.

* Maturity does not mean error-free. The only person who was perfect was Jesus himself.
* What is the nature of the maturity we are called to represent?

A Maturity Definition: _Being fully grown, completely functional and totally appropriate to the Lord's purposes and intents in the earth at the time._

* **_At the time_** implies an _evolving_ target as determined by the season and purpose of the Lord.
* A change in season brings divine activity to reveal areas for personal transformation in order to maintain a maturity that is relevant to Him.
* Because of the declarations made _"We must be a fortress"_, there are new definers for the state of maturity we must strive towards.
* How we respond to this process of judgment affects the building of the Lord into His future.


So what is the nature of the maturity? **Transformation** is the Expression of Maturity
* Part of the standard of maturity we are called to represent is how to be led by the Lord in a transformative journey out of personal deficiencies into higher levels of Christlikeness.

In this context, God's judgment is intended to lead us to maturity in Christ and NOT destruction or shame. This is directly opposed to what our flesh wants to respond.

God  is going to put His finger on things in our life that we would never

The judgment of the Lord is not to be feared or shied away from, but to be met with joy.

We are in a time when the light of the UR is shining brightly upon us.
Part of what the shining light does is reveals cracks and areas of misalignment.

How we respond to such Divine activity is important not only to our personal maturity but also to our Representation position before the Lord.

## The Parable of the Wheat and Tares

The field is symbolic of our lives in Time into which seeds are sown to produce a harvest. At the time of harvest, there is a process of judgment and separation in the field.

Matthew 13:24-30 (NKJV)

### The Harvest

 The harvest is the product of all (negative and positive) interactions with the field (our lives).
* The owner sows, but the enemy also

### Sowing and Reaping

 We are confronted here by the inescapable principle of sowing and reaping
* Galatians 6:7

### Reality of Divine Management

 Whatever the harvest, there was strategic and purposeful management by the Lord of all circumstances affecting the field.
* It is the owner's decision to allow the wheat & tares to grow together until the harvest

### Harvest Time is Judgment Time

Harvest time is a time of judgment when the opinion of the Lord about what He wants and does not want is made clear.
* Separation can only occur when we recognise and **accept** His opinion.
* Separation involves a sight of Self and the true state of our life in the eyes of the Lord.

### Joy is the End-Result

The entire process of judgment and separation is intended to end in joy and a greater capacity to shine in righteousness.
* Matthew 13:43
* In the midst of looking at ourselves in a way that might not be the most comfortable, we look at it in strength and courage in the hope that by confronting and changing, we end up with a joyful .

## Securing Victory in a Time of Judgment

Requires absolute faith and trust in the Lord who is managing the process.
* The experience of David after he is seduced by Satan to number Israel.

2 Samuel 24:12-14 NKJV

It is the knowledge of God's nature that provides the foundation for a mature response in a time of His judgment.

1. Take Full Responsibility
2. Contront self head-on
3. Avoid Getting Stuck in Regret
4. Endure the Momentary Discomfort unto Eternal Joy

### Take Full Responsibility

Harvest time requires us to take a deep inward look to examine the fruit of our journey to this point.

There is divine sowing into our lives but there is also "satanic" activity facilitated by "sleeping".
* Matthew 13:25
* Who is the responsible party here - the man who slept or the enemy who sowed?

What is sleeping?
* Ignorance or lack of knowledge of what is required
* seduction into making hasty life-decisions without adequate inquiry into the mind of the Lord.
* Life-priorities, energy and focus that are misdirected by the desires of Self.
* Wilful disobedience and rebellion against the standards of the Kingdom.

Accepting responsibility for the consequences of "sleeping" is critical to an effective process of separation as a response to the Lord's judgment.
* The owner does not spend time focusing on "tracking down the enemy."


What does Tracking Down the Enemy look like?
* Coming up with self-protecting justifications for actions taken
* Blaming external circumstances for decisions made
* Shifting blame on to others
* Blaming spiritual attack when it is actually self that is the assailant.


Taking responsibility is a pathway to true repentance and godly sorrow which leads to authentic transformation
* 2 Corinthians 7:10
* Avoid the path of "should've", "could've", "would've". That leads to a place of regret, and in that position is no space for God to speak.

Taking responsibility prepares the heart to accept and walk through any consequence or process deemed necessary by the Lord to lead us to a new place in Him.
* An account from David's life.
* Absalom?
* 2 Samuel 16:5-12 (MSG)

The readiness to take personal responsibility clears the way for the redemptive intent the Lord desires to release to us.

Taking personal responsibility also embeds humility into the foundation of our lives as we follow the Lord into newness.

Taking responsibility fortifies the desire to fully submit to any process of separation that leads to transformation regardless of the cost.

Taking responsibility puts self squarely in the crosshairs of a necessary death process.
