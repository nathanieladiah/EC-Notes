## A pattern of our Final Victory

A major aspect of the Old Testament is that the natural historical events recorded

Deuteronomy 28:1
> If you **fully obey** the Lord your God and **carefully follow** all his commands...

**"commands I give you today"**
* general commands, principles and emphases given in the Bible
* commands or emphases of God in a season
* specific words for a particular situation

If we practise obeying them, then we will have a good path, and enable us to fulfil all his purpose for us.

Commands from God may be:
* for life
* for a season of time
* for a particular occasion or situation or moment

If we do this then:
Deuteronomy 28:7
> The Lord will grant that the enemies who rise up against you will be defeated before you. They will come at you from one direction but flee from you in seven.

Once we carefully follow and fully obey then the Lord will enable us to overcome every attack and opposition of the enemy, every attempted blockage or hindrance from the dark realm. 

2 Corinthians 10:3-5
> For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.
> The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world.
> On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish **strongholds**.

Strongholds - the wrong opinions, mindsets and attitudes that fight against the truth and purpose of God in the minds and hearts of humans, both in society and in individual lives. 

* These things fight against the purpose of God in our lives.

Behind these strongholds are intelligent, evil supernatural beings that hate God.

We want to think like Christ thinks.

We can't be inhabiting a stronghold that Christ wants overthrown.

Our obedience is critical. We have to become a bride that is compatible with Christ.

The generation that crossed the Jordan, were ordinary. They partnered with God.

We can know much more of God and his ways than they did. We can learn from both their mistakes and their victories. 


1 Samuel 17

* If David had not stood up to Goliath, Israel would have become enslaved and oppressed as had happened many times before in the book of Judges.
* But more than that, they would have known less of God. They could have said God was all-powerful; but without that victory they would not have had that certainty

Who were the Philistines running from?
* They started to run before they were chased.
* David was just one man
* They had to be running from the Lord

# Amplifying Key Points
[[Marlon Jameson]]

Building a Fortress Life requires decisive and finalised lifestyle choices.

We cannot build this fortress life with our own natural efforts, we must face life partnering with God.

> What situations are you currently facing that the Lord is using to develop faith positions in you that contribute to His building of a "Fortress Life" in us as His finishing people?

Fortress Life: The Davidic Mentality

David's spiritual life was built like a fortress
* He was immune to intimidation 
* He possessed boldness and courage to confront darkness
* he could offer peace, protection and safety to others in times of crisis

1. A fortress Life is built out of a developed sense of partnership with the Lord while facing life's circumstances
	* I killed it... The Lord who rescued me 
2. Fortress Life requires us to make a faith connection between our circumstances and God's spiritual preparation of us for the future.
	* Facing the lion and the bear prepared David to defeat Goliath
3. Fortress Life requires trust and confidence in the maturity journey the Lord has led us on.
	* Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them
4. Fortress Life requires readiness to use our maturity and strength in the Lord for the benefit of others.
	* "Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him."
