The Bible repeatedly exhorts us to gaze/look/observe the Lord.
We need to focus on the correct image that comes from when we gaze at Christ.

Hebrews 12

_Gaze_ - look steadily and intently, especially in admiration, surprise, or thought

_Looking_ - to turn the eyes away from other things and fix them on something.

## Why are we gazing

1. Insight into the very nature, character, heart, motivation, and attitude of Christ himself
	*  Allows us to navigate the Highway
	* "I will be with you"
2. It is a catalyst for transformation
	* 2 Corinthians 3: 18 - And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory.
3. It calibrates the attitude of our heart for interaction with others (Representation/InGathering)	


## Our Focus: The Cross

If we had to choose one aspect, icon or image of Christ to focus upon what would it be?

Christ's death upon the Cross, and His subsequent resurrection, is the most profound revelation of HIs nature.
* It reveals in one glaringly powerful act the depth of His love, power and identification with humanity.



### 1. God is not distant

Everything about the nature and character of God can potentially create an insurmountable chasm between Him and us. 

* Psalms 8:3

And yet He chooses to insert Himself into time and mortality offering a pathway to salvation and relationship (story).
* Hosea 11:4
* Philippians 2: 5-8

By inserting Himself into mortality Christ completely identifies with:
1. the frailty of our human condition
2. the pain and struggle that often accompanies our walk upon the earth

	Hebrews 4:19

### 2. 

The Roman cross was one of the worst, and most fearsome devices of torture and execution ever devised.
* Death was slow and painful

It was also considered the most shameful form of death in ancient times
* No Roman citizen could be crucified, and it was generally not spoken about in Roman society

Beyond death it was an "act of state terror" psychological warfare and Roman propaganda.
It was designed to intimidate and crush all forms of political opposition.

Christ's death upon the Cross reveals the nature of true strength and  power.
This is not found in brute force, violence and the use of material resources but rather a life offered in obedience to God and service to others.

This challenges us - what do I depend upon? Where does my strength come from? Yielding to the authority of Christ?
* Philippians 2: 8
* Revelation 5:2-6

The laws that govern life in the Upper Realm are far more powerful system and ini direction contradiction to the laws that govern earthly systems, including the imperatives of our flesh.
* Foolishness in the eyes of man that is massive wisdom from God
* Weakness in the earth through yielding to God is strength in the Upper Realm 
* 1 Corinthians 1:18-20, 24-25

So we are seeing a key reality in the way the Upper Realm deals with the earth in the plans of God. 


### 3. An all powerful, all wise, sovereign god who is, at the core, redemptive

We are walking the Highway to Zion in the midst of a dark, broken and dying world
* Romans 8:28

You could not script the life of Jesus and death of Jesus even if you tried.
The capacity to bring it to pass through time is inconceivable

* "Satan just had to wait..."
* Isaiah 46: 9-11

The massive revelation of the Cross is that "honey can indeed be found in the carcass" because our God is redemptive.

John 10:10

What is required?
* Lift your eyes above the carnage.
	* 2 Corinthians 4:17-18
* Strength and courage
	* Joshua 1:9; Philippians 4:13
* Patience and Endurance
	* James 5:7-11
* Do not shrink back! Move decisively forward!

Jonah...
Behind the darkness falling upon the earth is the hand of God that is always extending mercy and seeking redemption.

Isaiah 61:1

### 4. The cross dismantles the Imperative of Self and Elevates the Imperatives of Otherness, Substitution and Representation (TFM)

The catastrophe that was the fall placed us under the domination of "self"
* Genesis 3:7

And yet no matter what you do "self" is a bottomless pit of dark energy
* Proverbs 30: 15

Romans 5:6-8

The pattern clearly demonstrated by Christ at the Cross is that denial of self releases life to others.
* 2 Corinthians 4:11-12
