# Enter the power of finalized maturity

Core intent - [[Maturity]] as the capacity to sustain

## Create a clear separation

Clear principle in the word of God,

- Levites were **separated** and **consecrated** unto the Lord.

Matthew 13:24-30

Paul's maturity Process - Philippians 3

Make sure to create a clear separation inside of our lives from what was before and what is no longer relevant.

Isaiah 52: 1, 11

## Do you understand? Get Knowledge!

Three termination images:
- Treasure in a field
- Pearl of great price
- Fish being sorted

Matthew 13:51 - Jesus asked 'Do you understand?'

The precursor for these images:
Matthew 13:10-12

Grace is released from the [Upper Realm] that allows us to understand.
Listening implies obeying. There is no point in listening and ignoring.

* Are you allowing the Grace to clothed your mentalities

When he asks 'Do you understand?', it is a deeper question.

## Keep watch! Stand your Ground!

"Habakkuk is a prophet who lived in the midst of darkness. He lived in the midst of things crashing down."

Hebrews 10:35-39

- Be strong and courageous!
- Keep watch! Stand your ground!
 - Don't shrink back! Remember he is coming.


# Embrace the Potential for Acceleration

[[David Taylor]]
[[Moving Forward from Knock 6]]

Our potential for acceleration is a factor of the nature of the Highway in front of us.

The Highway stands in stark contrast to the surrounding environment.

Highways are a finishing image in the Word.
Partnership and restoration of a relationship between man and God.

Isaiah 62: 10-11

1. Stay on the Highway - we cannot receive the benefits if we leave the path.
	- John 15:4-11
	- Remain relevant - connected, dependent, remain in Him
	- Not a one-off event
2. Looking forward and calling the future through our faith-filled lifestyle
	- 2 Peter 3: 11-14
	- Looking forward - connected to His promise.
	- the hopeful, deliberate alignment of our internal posture in agreement with the promis of the Upper Realm as we make every effort to stay 
3.  Be watchful as the day grows darker. Fully embrace functional, finalized maturity
	- 2 Peter 3:17-18

Isaiah 35:8-10
