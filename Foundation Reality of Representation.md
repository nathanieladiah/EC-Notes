# Clarifying a Vital Position

The past contains the secrets to understanding our current position.

The present is the result of a continuous stream of divine interactions flowing from the past - so the past and the present are one!

Understanding the actions of the past + staying within the stream of the spiritual journey provide the information to remain accurate in the future!

All resource from God is never forgotten or abandoned.

Mountains refer to:
* Points to the need for particular spiritual effort to comprehend and walk in the impartation being released by the Lord. There is personal effort required.
* Indicates the importance of these issues in the mind of the Lord as He guides the Congress towards the fulfilment of the journey that has been scripted by Him.

### Important Emphases from Last Time

* We cannot set our feet on the Highway to Zion without a clear and powerful embracing of the reality of Representation.
* The presentation of ourselves before the Lord makes spiritual cleanness and holiness mandatory & demands that personal and corporate humility is fully present.
* Ancient prophets declared and proclaimed that we "must be grieved for the affliction of Joseph". This represents a heart-cry for the Body of Christ.
* Our definition of a relevant and correct human life in the Kingdom in 2024 - 25 must include a yearning after the "safety, security and spiritual health of the Body of Christ."
* Representation WAS the essential nature of Jesus Christ.
* The core nature of His being was a desire that minimized SELF and reached out to ALL.
* An insignificant position in the earth has no bearing upon the mighty values of teh Upper Realm that are found in your life. all "insignificance MUST be aware of its heavenly significance."
* We strongly declare our 'embedded-ness' and our inseparable one-ness with the Body of Christ.
* 1 Corinthians 12:12-13


Definition :
* A desire birthed by the Holy Spirit in the heart of the Congress to stand before God with accurate biblical functionality on behalf of our brethren in the Church around the world, so that the Lord would ascribe our spiritual achievements and accomplishments on the behalf also.

### A Key Requirement for Finishing

Revelation 19:7

* Conscious, deliberate and strategic action taken by the Church

What is God's idea of "ready"?

Ephesians 4:13

However it is startingly clear that in its proclamations and practices the global church:
* Is locked away in former and now obsolete moves of God
* Misdirected by inaccurate and corrupt leaders
* Imprisoned in passivity and ignorance with no knowledge or experience of making a spiritual journey with the Lord.
* Meanwhile the Darkness is intensifying and total chaos is arriving as divine judgment falls.


Ezekiel 22:24-29
* There is a conspiracy of her princes withing her ... they devour people
* Her priests profane my holy things and make no difference between what is holy and what is unclean.
* Her officials kill people for dishonest gain.
* Her prophets give them false visions and lying divinations.
* The people oppress the poor, mistreat foreigners and deny justice.


.. And this is the solution:
* Ezekiel 22:30

* God Looks: Direct and precise interaction from teh Upper Realm into the earth realm from eternity into time
* Man position himself: 



This is what the Congress is:
* A people in the midst of the larger group standing (among them)
* A people committed to the building of spiritual strength
* A people (unit) whou would be selfless - not self-seeking
* A people willing to stand for the benefit of others.
