## Christlikeness & the Hebronite Dimension

> _"Representation WAS the essential nature of Jesus Christ"_ - DNW

Ephesians 5:25-26
> Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her,
> That he might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word

Our motivation to be like Christ is what should be driving us in this season.
This requirement for "just as" can only be achieved by standing exactly where Christ stands.

* Where was Jesus standing as our Head in relation to the Church?


### Christ Principle #1: The Power of a Biblically Approved Life

Carries the power to negotiate with the Lord on behalf of others.

> _"This is NOT a special Jesus Principle. It is a general principle of the Upper Realm"_

Therefore, this principle is available to us. We can do it without the requirement of being error-free.

In Egypt, an ordinary man who listened carefully to the instructions received the power to command the judgment to pass over his house.

Ezekiel 22:30
> I looked for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land...

We must position ourselves to be found.

### Christ Principle #2: The Approved Standard & Transformation

Christ is both the standard that covers us in representation and the destination of our transformation.
* We are becoming like the One who stands in representation of us.

Ephesians 5:26
> That he might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word

Jesus sanctifies and cleanses through the Word and He himself is the Word that sanctifies and cleanses.
Those called to cover others, must be aware that their life is the path to transformation for those they represent.
* Everything we do needs to be a representation of Christ. We must be like Christ.
* Our confidence in their arrival at maturity comes from our constant standing in the pattern of Christ.

### Christ Principle #3: A Representation Position Produces an Attitude of Mercy, Encouragement and Patience

Revelation 19:7
> Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready.

There is no judgment, irritation, intolerance or communication of disappointment surrounding our process of transformation.

It makes love the dominant attitude.

### Christ Principle #4: Living Under the Stringent Requirement for Sacrifice

> _"Not Me but ALL. Not my benefit but All. Inside the word ALL is the power of representation."_ - DNW

The Imperative of "All"
