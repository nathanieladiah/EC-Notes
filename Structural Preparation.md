A Powerful Call from the Lord for Individual and Community Preparation
* "Partners" in Divine Purpose and "Transporters" of the Lord's Grace

Preparation is connected to a Season of 'Rescue'
* Critical positioning of the 'called ones'

A Massive Focus on the 'Daughters' - a time of mature, functional womanhood
* Protectors of the Seed / Guardians of the Generations

A Command for the Youth to arise as a 'Genuine Partner' in the Divine Process

Arrival of Significant Spiritual Flows producing Separation.

The word of God divides between Truth and Falsehood.

## Two Core Realities

1. The resolute commitment of the Lord to resource and build His mature, prevailing church!
2. The arrival of severe conditions, designed to produce crisis in the season of the End!


Matthew 16:18
> ... I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.

The building of Fortress structures - both individual and corporate - in the midst of the advancing darkness, is the only context for light, hope and safety

Proverbs 18:10
> The _name_ of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.

To build Fortress structures is to walk in ***The Way of Holiness*** and to be ***separate*** from the surrounding darkness.
* Isaiah 35:9-10
> But only the redeemed will walk there, and those the Lord has rescued will return.

### Crisis is Linked to Separation

Test and validate the quality and authenticity of all building

1 Corinthians 3:13
> each one's work will become clear; for the Day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one's work, of what sort it is. 


Create genuine spiritual sight and produce a deep cry for mercy (Rescue)
Psalm 18:6
> In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried out to my God; He heard my voice from his temple, and my cry came before Him, even to His ears.

2 Timothy 3:1-4; 10-11; 14-15 NKJ
A command to emphatically separate from all aspects of the pervasive but depraved way of life in the days of the end!

A requirement to not only reject the depraved standards but to ***wholeheartedly submit*** one's life to the validated pattern!

In 2 Tim 3, Paul provides clear instructions for securing prevailing Fortress life and separation from the surrounding darkness.
* Closely follow the delivered doctrine and life patterns
* Continue in ...

Follow = Walk in the exactness of the Christ structure of FORTRESS LIFE

John 14:6

Matthew 4:19

Acts 17:28

Psalm 18:2

## Followership Foundations

Ephesians 4:7, 11 - 12
* Actual resource that Christ sends to facilitate His building. Christ is building Himself.

The Grace to build comes through the Life of a Man

Ephesians 3:2
> If indeed you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given to me for your

John 1:17
> For the law was given through Moses, _but_ grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.

Access to the Grace requires Accurate Following

1 Corinthians 11:1
> Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ.

* To follow as a pattern or model
* To be (or appear) like
* To produce a copy of (reproduce)
