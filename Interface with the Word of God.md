# Intro

Be competent
1. We have to represent
2. We have to be able to strongly all on God at the time of ingathering.

Matthew 5:13-16
Jeremiah 31:21

Patterns from Jesus
Hebrews 5:7-9
* Pathway to maturity is not a passive activity

Reverent submission or Godly Fear
* Includes caution, restraint of will to act on one's own will

Hebrews 12:28

Service that's acceptable
* powered not by human effort but by available grace

Isaiah 61:1
Psalms 145

Lessons:

1. I have to be able to stand and fight in my own personal sphere of life
2. My own life must contain the resources that must sustain me
3. The reality of the Kingdom became much more defined by my own personal state of existence in the midst of this crisis.
4. The importance of my own life and spiritual condition to the general global movement of the Kingdom became more clearly emphasised.
5. It became critically clear that I have to be competent, skilful, informed and very functional in my knowledge and application of the word of God into my personal life.

Hebrews 4:12
* The word is sharp and double-edged - Destroys darkness but gives power to light
* Separates between our earthly nature and preference that arrives from the Upper Realm


John 6:63

life -> not biological life: life that comes directly from God in the upper realm

## The Correct attitude

2 Timothy 2:15
* Talking about handling day to day living here in this realm

2 Timothy 3:14-17
* The word corrects but also teaches us what is right.

James 1:22-25
* need to have a desire to implement the word or else just listening to it just fades away

Read Psalms 119

Luke 24
