Matthew 6:22

### Who was Thomas?

His maturity was incomplete because he lacked faith and doubted.

Romans 12:22


The starting point = The Upper Realm.

Hebrews 11:1

I have faith **In** God; He is the source of our faith. What is truly important is our sight of God, His nature and character.

To walk the highway is to engage.
