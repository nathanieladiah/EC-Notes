Luke 21:25-26

1 Thessalonians 5:8
> But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the **hope of salvation as a helmet**.

When the word uses _hope_, it means certainty.

Hebrews 6:19
- Anchor - Hope is a direct connection into the very presence of God.

Romans 15:13
> May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
