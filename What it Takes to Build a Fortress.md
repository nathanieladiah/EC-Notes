#ECCG


## The Highway Context

* As the heavy pressure of daily life grinds down on the souls of people in the earth our KCs must become sanctuaries. Not the building or church services, but the community within them.

* As the darkness increases in the earth our communities must be filled with Light and reflect clearly the nature and character of our Lord in the earth.

* As we move nearer and nearer to the Finish the desperation level in the realm of Darkness will increase and the attacks on the churches will become more severte.

* Therefore our KCs must be pillars of strength to uphold the movement of the Lord.

* As the end draws near, the completion of the Body of Christ is on the mind of the Father. Our churches must be positioned for significant intake as the season of InGathering draws near.

* Structure and culture must be pristine.

These things must be true in our personal lives as well as for the corporate structures.

* The leaders & saints of our churches have to be empowered with confidence, competence & spiritual capability. They also have to be informed so that tracking is accurate and precise.


1 Corinthians 1:10 NIV
> I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say (externalizing of life) and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.

* One group of people walking in the earth, showing that we agree in what we think and say. **My actions and words don't distort the nature of Christ or the preference of God.**

* Our aim is unity and oneness. In our families and individual life. Not a broken or imperfect life.

### Corporate Imperatives

* KCs must be Sanctuaries
* KCs must be filled with lIght
* KCs must be pillars of strength
* KCs must be positioned for InGathering
* Saints must be Partners and be Empowered

Our churches must indeed become fortresses.
