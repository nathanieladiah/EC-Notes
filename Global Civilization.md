#ECCG 

Deuteronomy 4:6
> 6 Obey them completely, and you will display your wisdom and intelligence among the surrounding nations. When they hear all these decrees, they will exclaim, ‘How wise and prudent are the people of this great nation!’

The transformation experienced by all of us together has strengthened our Global Civilization by causing us to stand in new places of personal maturity in Christ.

Lying at the core of GC is our increased Oneness facilitated by a common journey of transformation.

* Increased our capacity to knock as one people on the door of Eternity demanding that the Lord bring about eternity
* Increased to express as one people our capture of the nature of God to the Upper Realm.

Now more than ever, we are one synchronized and integrated people moving to the Finish under the miraculous, transformational power of the Apostolic Grace.

It is very evident that something supernatural has come down from the Upper Realm and providing the capacity to change during this season.
It is our oneness that sustains this supernatural power that is driving our corporate movement; therefore, our state of oneness must be guarded.

Psalms 133:1, 3
> 1 How wonderful and pleasant it is  
>     when brothers live together in harmony!  
 
> 3 Harmony is as refreshing as the dew from Mount Hermon  
>     that falls on the mountains of Zion.  
> And there the Lord has pronounced his blessing,  
 >    even life everlasting.

Oneness causes the spiritual atmospherics of a higher place ...

Goshen = drawing near.

By the time departure came, Israel was fed and kept safe by another power even while in Egypt. 
Fed; instructed; ordered; and protected.

Colossians 3:1-2
> 1 Since you have been raised to new life with Christ, set your sights on the realities of heaven, where Christ sits in the place of honour at God’s right hand. 2 Think about the things of heaven, not the things of earth.

This awareness must create in us as a global civilization a final rejection of the authority of Time and the Earth to define who we are.

This awareness must lead us as a Global Civilization into a way of life suitable for the upper realm.

Colossians 3:4-5
> 4 And when Christ, who is your life, is revealed to the whole world, you will share in all his glory.
> 
> 5 So put to death the sinful, earthly things lurking within you. Have nothing to do with sexual immorality, impurity, lust, and evil desires. Don’t be greedy, for a greedy person is an idolater, worshiping the things of this world.

Looking at Jesus - The Immortal Man
* Jesus returned as a transformed person

* He submitted to the death process and is radically transformed into a new state. Walking in the earth, but ready for eternity.
	* Luke 24:44
	 > 44 Then he said, “When I was with you before, I told you that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms must be fulfilled.”
	 
* A transformed Jesus emphasised and strengthened the foundations of the corporate spiritual journey.

	* Increased knowledge of the word of God
	* Edified and established those around Him by interactions intended to increase knowledge.

* Heart for restoring the broken
	* A transformed Jesus demonstrated a heart for those on the periphery of the community and desire
	* Applies not just to Congress WBN but also to the Body of Christ

* Offered New partnership for the finish
	* Matthew 28:18-20
	* Offered empowerment and partnership to those whom God had given to Him as His community to finish the Mission

* Protected His State of Consecration unto the Lord - to be set apart as holy
	* John 21:17
	* Guarded his purity and sense of consecration unto the Lord as He interacted with the Earth.

As it was for Jesus and his disciples, the internal life of our Global civilization must be focused on strengthening one another for a day of new advance as we move deeper into the purposes of the Lord.

Colossians 3:12-15
> 12 Since God chose you to be the holy people he loves, you must clothe yourselves with tenderhearted mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. 13 Make allowance for each other’s faults, and forgive anyone who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others. 14 Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds us all together in perfect harmony. 15 And let the peace that comes from Christ rule in your hearts. For as members of one body you are called to live in peace. And always be thankful.

Hebrews 10:24-25
> 24 Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works. 25 And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his return is drawing near.
