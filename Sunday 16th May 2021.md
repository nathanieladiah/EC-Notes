Pay maximum attention and think of the things God is telling us.
God is preparing us for later.

Isaiah 48:6-7
joy - God, I want to learn
active discovery of the new 'Me'.

Darkness advances as we advance, increases.
Deuteronomy 32:17

The instructions that tell us how to succeed and walk come from the invisible realm.
* But God has given us the ability to hear and be guided by him

Matthew 5:16 - my life must emit light
