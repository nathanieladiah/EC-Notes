Jeremiah 51

Reviewing some strong platforms

### 1. Accelerating into the crisis

Hebrews 12:26-29
2 Peter 3:10-14

The unshakable nature of the Kingdom is within (Luke 17:21)

The need to have a thankful life
Spiritually appropriate
Live a holy and godly life

1. There is resource in the Holy Spirit - The power of the holy spirit will always reinforce what God is saying
2. God isn't crazy - there has to be an available relevant context that is consistent with what he is telling us

### 2. There is a famine in the land

Amos 8:11-13
We must appreciate the banquet that God has provided us with.

Psalms 33:18-20
Genesis 41:54-57


### 3. We must Discern the nearness of the finish

Lamps...
This is a biblical definition of the state of the church in the days of the preparation for the return

Luke 21:25-31

### 4. We must resource the saints

Jeremiah 31:10-14

Judges 5:1,2,9
