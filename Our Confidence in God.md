In the midst of the increasing evil and instability of the earth, we are required to have an increasingly firm and settled faith in God as we move towards the Finish.

John 14:1
- Just don't be depressed?

## Our Response to the Chaos

1. Our confidence is in who God is.
	* Hebrews 11:6 

2. We are totally confident that we receive eternal life from Christ.
	* John 6:37 
		* The gifts God usually references is people.

3. We have been chosen by Christ.
	* John 15:16 
	* Appointed implies that you are placed in a particular position of responsibility.
	* Don't envy someone with a gift you think is more spectacular than yours. Find out what God has given you to do, and do it.
	* Our 'fruit' must have eternal value.

	God wants from you the particular fruit that he has planned for you to produce.
	Leads to a spiritual competition, if you are comparing to others.
	* Ephesians 2:10

4. We have confidence that God will help us in every situation of life.
	* Hebrews 13:5
		> He has said, "I will never fail you or forsake you"
	
	- This is an absolute promise.
		This is quoted from Joshua 1:5. Therefore it will especially apply in the final battles.

	Part of the reason for our confidence in God relates to what he has said he would do for us.
	
	We can get to know and understand God, and what he wants from us, both corporately and personally.
	This gives us total confidence in moving towards the Finish.


Psalm 32:8-9
> The Lord says, "I will guide you along the best pathway for your life.
> I will advise you and watch over you.
> Do not be like a senseless horse or mule that needs a bit and bridle to keep it under control."

Don't make the Lord have to force you into a right path. Just do what he says.
Whether or not its' comfortable or convenient, it will work out best in the long run.


## Our Focus

**Fix** these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. 
Deuteronomy 11:18

But my eyes are **fixed** on you, Sovereign Lord; in you I take refuge - do not give me over to death. 
Deuteronomy

Let our eyes look straight ahead; **fix** your gaze directly before you. 
Proverbs 4:25

So owe **fix** our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
2 Corinthians 4:18

Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, **fix** your thoughts on Jesus, whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest. 
Hebrews 3:1

...**fixing** our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith.
Hebrews 12:2


## Our Significance

There will be attempts of the enemy to try and break our confidence by shifting our focus to the natural.

1 Corinthians 1:26-30
