The idea of _readiness_: Requires context, partnership, and expectation of an ending.

Ephesians 4:13
> … the full and complete standard of Christ

## A Starting Place

The starting place for all prescribed Kingdom expression is _internal apprehension and capture_.
Luke 17:21
> …  For indeed, the kingdom of God is within you.
* Cry for sight and transaction.

### What must we capture?

1. The reality that my life, as an individual, and our life, corporately, is of critical significance to the purpose of God.
	*  Show me the importance of my own life
	* Rejection all natural markers of insignificance
	* Eschewing desire for carnal significance

2. A genuine love and concern for the Body of Christ.
	* Movement beyond doctrine = this is who we are
	* 1 John 4: 16
	> God is love

3. The actual reality and possibility of the 'Finish'.
	* Joyous rejection of the current state of affairs and embracing of a new and better future.
	* Revelation 18:4
	> Then I heard another voice from heaven say, "Come out of her, my  people"

4. This is the most important thing.
	* Focus and determination that comes from a clear understanding of the mission.
	* Matthew 6:22
	> If your eyes are healthy, you whole body will be full of light
	

Luke 6:43-44
> A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart.

# Standing as a Man Among Them

Ezekiel 22:24-29

God is looking for a people that will stand amidst the danger, and are selfless and committed to building spiritual strength.

This is the purpose of us being brought into the Kingdom of God.

## God Looks...

We are gaining deeper awareness of the importance and functionality of being a Core Structure.
* Representation always starts from the Core.

For God to **'see'** us when he looks, our spiritual presence must be very visible from the Upper Realm.

Job 1:8

We need to ensure the quality of our life makes us 'detectable' from the Upper Realm - Blameless, Upright, Fear God, Shun Evil
*  Avoid the scramble for human significance.

To function in Representation, God must see us as ONE singular 'person' from the Upper Realm.

John 17:20-23
