# Escaping the Deception of the Times


Stand in the Place Where God is!

Isaiah 55:8-9
> 8 "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways", declares the LORD.


The call to stand where God is, is intended to produce an upward shift in how we think and how we llive.
* An elevation in perception that produces a more spiritually effective lifestyle as we move to the Finish.


### Looking at Jesus Speaking to his Disciples

John 4:35 NKJV
> Do you not say, "There are still four months and then comes the harvest"? Behold I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest!

What do we see?

* Perception shapes our reality and determines the patterns of thought that dominate our minds.
* How we perceive reality around us affects our spiritual attitude.
	* There is a certain expectation of the Lord about how we think and react to things around us.
* The perspective of Christ is fundamentally different and opposed to the perspective of Time.
	* The earth is shouting there is no hope, but 
* Becoming like Christ in how we think brings change to our perception of reality around us.
* Becoming like Christ in how we think will change how we engage the environment around us
	* We will use the tools necessary for the harvest now instead of in four months
	* This gives us a whole new energy of life
* The perspective of Christ reveals the truth concerning the Finish which is hidden by events of Time.
* If we stand where Christ is, our perspective shifts and we are able to perceive new possibilities for thinking, action and responses that Time will never allow us to see.

### From the Perspective of Time...

Our movement to the Finish is defined by:
* The dramatic failure of human wisdom and leadership at all levels.
* The steady and progressive collapse of systems that support life.
* The irreversible collapse of systems in the natural environment.
* The pursuit of profit overwhelming all ethical and moral boundaries.
* The horrific display of evil by those with power against those without

It is all hopeless. Chaos surrounds us. Disaster is unavoidable. Humanity is on a "Highway to Hell". All is lost.

### But...

God's purpose cannot end in chaos and disorder
* The governing Divine command upon Creation remains "Let there be light" 

God's purpose cannot end in hopelessness and despair
* This does not express the truth of who He is, the dimension in which He dwells and what He has promised. (Romans 8:28)

God's purpose cannot end with total systemic collapse and failure
* His peace and government increase without end


### Therefore

* What is the truth of our movement ito the Finish?
* What is the view of the Finish from the place where God is?
* What is the attitude of the UR  as it looks down upon the times we are in?


### From the Perspective of the UR

The movement to the Finish is defined by:
*  All things coming to perfection and maturity (Ephesians 4:13)
	* Make this point of view our starting point for all our actions
	* Our hearts will become filled with joy, hope, and confidence.
* All of God's plans are arriving at fulfilment (Isaiah 55:11)
	* We hold on to this as a personal ...
	* No challenge on the earth can derail this
* The accomplishment  of the original Divine intent in creating Man (Genesis 1:27) 
	* The perfection of the alignment of man with God is almost complete.
	* We are standing in a place of almost perfection.
* The mature harvest of the sacrifices of the heroes of faith who await us on the other side (Hebrews 11:49-50)
* The culmination of a precisely sequenced process of building over hundreds of years


There is a clash between the perspective of the Upper Realm and the perspective of the Earth.
We need to choose the perspective we dwell in in the upcoming years.

There is a clash of perspectives that must be resolved in our hearts and minds as we walk along the Highway through the wilderness.

What is at stake in this battle is the certification of our maturity as it is tested by an earth that is getting darker as its systems continue to fail around us. 
* Ephesians 4:13-14 (NIV)


Are things falling apart in chaos or are things coming together in perfection?
* In which of these realities are we standing to engage with life at the End of Time?


Luke 21:25-26
27-28

Isaiah 35:8-10

While walking through the crisis of our day, we are expected by the Lord to be encased in the Joy of the Lord.

To declare that the Finish is close is to also declare that the final perfection of God's plan is also close.
