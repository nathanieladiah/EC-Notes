Faith is connected to the future

Hebrews 11:1
> Faith shows the reality of what we hope for; it is the evidence of things we cannot see.

Faith is based on divine communication. It caused man to begin to act.

He is not motivated by earthly directives.
There is a necessity to move even before the sight of the promise.
