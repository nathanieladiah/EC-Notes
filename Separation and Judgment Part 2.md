# Be Open & Transparent

Regret and shame in a season of judgment and separation can produce distance in our relationship with the Lord.

This is a response of the flesh which aids the intent of Satan to cut us off from the redemptive and transformative power of the Lord available to us in the current season.

### Looking again at David

It is clear from looking at David's response to the Lord's judgment in the sordid mater involving Uriah and Bathsheba that he  was able to overcome this spiritual stumbling block.

What was the state of David's heart that allowed him to overcome.

Restoration and redemption are transactional in nature. There has to be an offering in your heart that God responds with restoration and redemption.

They are divine  responses to an acceptable offering and posture of the human heart when confronted.

### Psalm 51

Provides a view into the posture of David's heart in his season of judgment.

> _For the choir director: A psalm of David, regarding the time Nathan the prophet came to him after David had committed adultery with Bathsheba._
>
> 1. Have mercy on me, O God, because of your unfailing love. Because of your great compassion, blot out the stain of my sins.
> 2. Wash me clean from my guilt. Purify me from my sin.
> 3. For I recognize my rebellion; it haunts me day and night.
> 4. Against you, and you alone, have I sinned; I have done what is evil in your sight. You will
> 5.
> 6. But you desire honesty from the womb, teaching me wisdom even there.
> 7. Purify me from m y sins, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
> 8. Oh, give me back my joy again; you have broken me - now let me rejoice.
> 9. d
> 10. Create in me a clean heart, O God. Renew a loyal spirit within me.
> 11. Do not banish me from your presence, and don't take your Holy Sprit from me.
> 12. Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and make me willing to obey you.
> 13. Then
> 14. Forgive me for shedding blood, O God who saves; then I will joyfully sing of your forgiveness.
> 15. Unseal my lips, O Lord, that my mouth may praise you.
> 16.
> 17. The sacrifice you desire is a broken spirit. You will not reject a broken and repentant heart, O God.
> 18. Look


David refuses to present a "sanitized" version of himself as he interacts with the Lord in a season of judgment.
* Mary vs Martha: The preference of the Lord when He visits.
* God is not afraid of the mess. It is better to present ourselves to him as we are.

He brings into the presence of the Lord the most unseemly parts of his life that were revealed through the Lord's confrontation of his sin.

David is "Undressed", open and completely vulnerable before the Lord as he interacts with him in a season of judgment

No excuses are offered.
* "**_My_** guilt"; "I recognize **_my_** rebellion"

He stands face to face with the Lord and avoids creating any buffer by referencing any facilitative circumstances
* "Against you and you alone have I sinned"

He defines to the Lord the spiritual drift and damage that have occurred within him.

He is confident in the Lord's power and desire to heal, renew and restore that which is brought before Him in an imperfect state.
* "create "


The Davidic heart provides a foundadtion for a productive and transformative response to the Lord's judgment.

It prioritises openness and transparency as we interact with the Lord in a season of judgment and separation.
* This is not for the Lord's benefit, but for ours.

A season of judgment requires a heart posture of openness and transparency in order to receive the joy of separation and to arrive at the place of newness before the Lord.

# Endure the (_Momentary_) Discomfort unto (_Eternal_) Joy


The process of separation and judgment unfolds in **Time** (through events, circumstances, consequences) but its intent is to produce an outcome in **Eternity**.
* Matthew 13:43 - Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.

2 Corinthians 4:17-18

> 17 For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.

Paul is revealing a dynamic connection between the circumstances of Time and the dimension of Eternity that must form part of the mature perspective of every saint as we walk through the season of the Lord's judgment.

### A Mature Perspective

The circumstances and challenges that the Lord ordains for us to walk through in a season of separation and judgment are connected to the formation of our Eternal life in Christ
This understanding produces a corrective impact on our way of thinking and response to our circumstances.

### A Corrective Impact

Challenges and difficulties are not reliable indicators that something has gone wrong in our life.

There is more at stake than simply escaping a difficult situation, circumstance or consequence. Something is being formed.

**How we respond** to our ordained circumstances yields a **formative impact** upon things that cannot always be seen.

God is not primarily interested in our deliverance from trial, challenge and difficulty. Rather He is evaluating the maturity that develops in us as we face them with Biblical correctness.

2 Corinthians 4:17

**"an eternal glory"** - an opinion formed after evaluation resulting in praise an honour.
* **"Who are we?"** is the question being asked of us by the process of the Lord.
* Our response must shout to Him from Time **"We are of Christ!"**

The judgment and opinion of the Lord concerning who we are must weight more in our minds than any present distress we are confronting.
The Lord's opinion is the glory that far outweighs everything in our lives.

2 Corinthians 4:17 - 18

> 18 So we fix our eyes not on what is seen (_the challenges_), but on what is unseen (_the formation_), since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal


The awareness of the dynamic connection between how we live in Time and what is being formed in Eternity:
* Breaks within us the limiting power of a Time-based perspective
* Causes us to focus upon what is being formed in us by facing what we must
* Releases the power to endure the formation of the Lord with joy and hope.

Hebrews 12:2 NIV

> Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

* Scorn - to think little or nothing of something; to diminish the importance of a thing.

Christ understood that the present "shame" of the cross was producing an eternal and glorious future for Him and us as His body together.

Because of this awareness he received the power to endure all that came with it unto the attainment of the joy that awaited Him.

## Defining the Cross

The Cross represents the God-ordained circumstances of challenge, difficulty or distress to our flesh (Self) that are designed by the Lord to produce and perfect HIs intended future and eternal plan for us.

For Christ, the power of salvation could not be transacted without the pain and discomfort to His flesh of carrying the cross.

Luke 9:23 (NKJV)

> Then He said to them all, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, And follow Me."

With these words, Jesus personalizes the principle of the cross to everyone who desires to become like him.

It is impossible to achieve Christlikeness without a cross to carry.

What then is the power of the Cross that Jesus commends us all to walk in in a season of judgment and separation?

### Conversion Power

* The power to convert earthly negativity into eternal glory.
* the power to convert pain, discomfort and challenge into joy, peace and hope.
* the power to convert the resistance



### What then is Christlikeness (in a season of judgment & separation)?

The conversion power to cause the challenges of life in the brokenness of Time and mortality to produce the perfection of the eternal plan of God.
