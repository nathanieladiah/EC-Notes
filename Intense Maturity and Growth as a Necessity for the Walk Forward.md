God cannot finalize His purpose without maturity appearing in the earth.
No cone of intensification if there is not a process of intensification in the heart of everyone..

Intensification is not:
* Carnal flesh-based activity that defines maturity as more of the the same - There needs to be change, movement

It is
* Intensification as practicalisation
* Matthew 7:24-25
