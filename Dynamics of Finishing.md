* To activate a new and urgent flow of 'arrow prayers', triggered by the Word of God, for personal and finalized spiritual development.
* To receive from the Word more discovering of the dynamics for a powerful Finishing Technology.

# Part One: Principles of the Word of God


There was considerable effort and cost to produce the record that we call the Word of God. Lives lost, etc.

John 1:14

The  word of god must transform me in some way.
The grace from the word will provide the transformation.
