Romans 9:8
Galatians 3:29

Abraham is the father of faith.
* The starting point of our faith
* Movement from limitationo

Hebrews 11:8
* Obedience
* Place of absolute newness

Genesis 12:1- 
* Lots of 'blessing'
* We don't know quite yet what this place is or what the rules of this place are.

We too are being called into a future:
* transformation and growth
* ingathering
* new skills and tools for productivity

A 'propelling force' was acting on Abraham

Psalms 29

Mobilised by irresistible voice of the Lord:
* crippling the nations, destroying their strength
* crushing the dominance of the natural realm over us
* causing us who are His Temple to cry "Glory!"

new platform without modifying behaviours is meaningless
