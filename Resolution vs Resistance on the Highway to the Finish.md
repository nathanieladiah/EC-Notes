## Understanding the Consequences

We release ferocious response just by walking on the Highway.
We should not expect gentleness flowing to us from the realm of darkness.

The dimension of opposition cannot:
* Stand in the place where God is.
* Be synchronized with the will of God
* Love the Body of Christ
* Walk towards maturity & respond accurately in days of divine judgement
* Hear

## A Historical Enemy

1 Chronicles 21:11
Job 2:22
Zechariah 3:11
Mark 1:13

**He uses Intimidation and Force:**
1 Peter 5:8

**He sets traps and snares to catch you:**
* 1 Timothy 3:7
* 2 Timothy 2:26

The full structure of the enemy's weapons may be used against us.

**He uses schemes and trickery to outwit us when we are not attentive**
* 2 Corinthians 2:11

**He has the power to blind minds**
* 2 Corinthians 4:4
* 2 Corinthians 4:6
Every time God speaks about sight, it refers to engaging with the _light_.
There can be no sight without light.

**He is fixated upon destruction and disaster:**
* John 10:10

**He presents himself as an agent of the Lord**
* 2 Corinthians 11:14

## If we are Walking the Highway to Zion...

 We must:
* Have enough Internal Spiritual Force and Courage to Overcome his intimidation.
 * Be able to avoid the traps that are set by deliberately walking in the correct safe paths of the Lord.
 * Have minds full of Light and hears full of the living Word of the Lord (Doctrine as well as His dynamic)
 * Have powerful discernment and sight that is the product of purity of life and mission
	 * Matthew 5:88
