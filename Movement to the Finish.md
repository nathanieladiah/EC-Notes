# A Powerful Word From Christ - Be Relevant!

John 12:26

- A final looking away from the enticements of this world:

- Luke 17:32
- John 17:16

- Receiving a massive 'prophetic impartation' to literally live by the constant hearing of guidance from the Lord.
- Finalization of Personal Transformation and conquering the darkness by implementing practical lifestyle decisions powered by spiritual principles from the Word.
- The FINAL formation of Community as an expression of the life of Christ in corporate reality.
