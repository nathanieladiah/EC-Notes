#ECCG

- A threat to the very existence of human life on planet earth as we know it today
- The very real potential that all of life could be eradicated, soon

Rooted - to be fixed onto something. Causes stability.

- To be developed by something - receive nutrients from something

Acts 17:28
- We have to find ourselves 'in Christ'.

An urgent call from the Upper Realm for both awareness and correct/appropriate action relevant to where God is located right now.

Romans 13:11-12

## The Last Plague

The Lord devastates Ancient Egypt and end with Exit.

1. Unlike the previous plagues, God's people are not potentially at risk and failure will result in abortion
2. Prior to this, God was acting unilaterally through the efforts of one man

1. God speaks to Moses, and Moses would act
2. Now there is a requirement for partnership not with a single man but with a mature company
3. Exodus 12: 21-22

1. Everyone was getting clear instructions

God has made every provision to secure His people BUT we must put the blood on the doorposts.

	2. Our families must be completely sealed, and can respond as one unit.

3. Establishing oneself within the safety of community
	1. "If a family is too small … let them share with another"

## Victory is our starting context…

Christ's sacrifice opened a portal into a vast world of resource that provides the foundation for a victorious life as we walk through the darkness to the end of time.
