Hebrews 12:26-28
> 26 At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens." 27 The words “once more” indicate the removing of what can be shaken—that is, created things—so that what cannot be shaken may remain.
>
> 28 Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe,

The strength of God: plunged the entire world into uncertainty and exposed the core weakness of the systems of the earth.

Jeremiah 16:9-11
> 9 For this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Before your eyes and in your days I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in this place.
>
> 10 “When you tell these people all this and they ask you, ‘Why has the Lord decreed such a great disaster against us? What wrong have we done? What sin have we committed against the Lord our God?’ 11 then say to them, ‘It is because your ancestors forsook me,’ declares the Lord, ‘and followed other gods and served and worshiped them. They forsook me and did not keep my law.

_Acts 9:31_
> Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it increased in numbers.

_Proverbs 19:23_
> The fear of the Lord leads to life;  
    then one rests content, untouched by trouble.

We will not be afflicted by the calamity. It will not break our faith or destroy us. We thank God for the journey; it is the power of the journey...

_Exodus 29:46_
> They will know that I am the Lord their God, who brought them out of Egypt so that I might dwell among them. I am the Lord their God.

God brought us on a journey so that he could be with us, and strengthen us - so we would not be broken.

_Leviticus 25:55_
> “‘If one of your fellow Israelites becomes poor and sells some of their property, their nearest relative is to come and redeem what they have sold.

God is looking for those who will serve him, carrying out his purposes. This is why we were brought on this journey.

_Leviticus 26:13_
> I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt so that you would no longer be slaves to the Egyptians; I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to walk with heads held high.

We would not bow under the power of the earth.

> My House is filled with Light!


_1 John 1:7_
> But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.

God is our reference point.

_Psalms 119:105_
> Your word is a lamp for my feet,  
    a light on my path.

_1 Thessalonians 4:1-2_
> As for other matters, brothers and sisters, we instructed you how to live in order to please God, as in fact you are living. Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more. 2 For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.


_2 Peter 1:19_
> We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.

We are strengthened by the great hope of the nearness of the Finish.

_Romans 15:13_
> May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

_Isaiah 40:31_
> but those who hope in the Lord  
    will renew their strength.  
They will soar on wings like eagles;  
    they will run and not grow weary,  
    they will walk and not be faint.

It is the knowledge that the finish is drawing close that gives us massive joy and confidence.

The finish is a season of Faith and Joy at the end of hard Journey! We must not retreat and fail. Together we knocked on the Door of God.

_James 5:7-8_
> 7 Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord’s coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains. 8 You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord’s coming is near.
