Satan's Deceptions:
* Love of money
* Love of pleasure
* Confusion of sexual orientation and sexual identity
* No thought or consideration of life after death
* Ignorance of God

2 Corinthians 11:3
> But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.

1. The deception is aimed at our minds
2. The word 'sincere' translates to a double meaning - mentally honest

The aim of the false apostles at Corinth was to downgrade the quality of the commitment to Christ of the believers.

Genesis 2:8-9
> 8 Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. 9 The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. 

Genesis 2:15-16
> 15 The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. 16 And the Lord God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden;

## The Start of Deception

Genesis 3:1
> Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?”

Satan's questions are full of evil hints. There is distortion of the actual words of God but also a much more subtle level of misrepresentation and slandering of God's character.

By subtly focusing Eve's attention to the one prohibition rather than to the abundant supply, Satan is persuading her to doubt God's goodness. There is a lie behind the lie.

Genesis 3: 2
> The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,

* She associated God only with the restriction. The permission was glossed over and made impersonal. Not something to be grateful for or to appreciate.
* She missed out the word **'freely'**.
* She missed out the word **'any'**.
* She downplayed the intensity of the warning - missing out **'certainly'**
* She didn't name the tree
* She added something that God never said **'you may not touch it'**

**Do not** have discussions with the devil, resist him and chase him away.

Satan recognized that he has convinced Eve that God is untruthful, unreasonable and restrictive and that he's trying to keep Eve from reaching her full potential.

Eve has accepted Satan's words.

Genesis 3:4-5
> 4 “You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman. 5 “For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”

Eve's inner self had already been compromised.

## Deceptions in the church

2. People wanting to suffer, because they think they deserve it.
3. Thinking that outward ministry is more important to God than inner character
		Matthew 7: 21
	* What is the will of the father?
	* Which of God's laws were broken?

1 John 3:7-10
> 7 Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. The one who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. 8 The one who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work. 9 No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been born of God. 10 This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not God’s child, nor is anyone who does not love their brother and sister.

Matthew 7: 24-27
> 24 “Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. 26 But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. 27 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.”

We must listen **and** obey.
Luke 4: Need to know scripture along with the context.

## Defences Against Deception

1. Obey God when He speaks.

	* Proverbs 1: 20-33
	* Hebrews 3:13
2. Refuse the lures of evil people
	* Proverbs 1:10-19
3. Love the truth
	* 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12

## The end of Deception

Isaiah 32:1-5
Malachi 3:16

In the end, all deceptions will be exposed and we'll never be in danger from then again.
