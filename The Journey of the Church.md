#ECCG

Egypt is a wrong system. Bricks vs stones.
The stones had to be selected in order to fit together.
The bricks were all clones and had to be held together by foreign substances.

The journey is about moving _and_ changing.
The journey was not a continuous motion, it happened in pulsations and stages.

It is Divine Intent that the people understand the architecture of the movement of God.

When you hit the fire, you touch God.
