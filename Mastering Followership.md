# Notes on Integrity

Proverbs 11:3

Psalm 25:21
>May integrity and uprightness protect me, because my hope, LORD, is in you.
* completeness of structure; wholeness of form with no open cracks.

Proverbs 13:6
> Righteousness guards the person of integrity, but wickedness overthrows the sinner.
* This is armour: Moral innocence and determination to stay pure

2 Corinthians 1:12 NIV
> 12 Now this is our boast: Our consicence testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, with integrity and godly sincerity. We have done so, relying not on worldly wisdom but on God's grace.
* _Haplotes_: internal purity exploding from within
* _Eilikrineia_: clearness and transparency.

> 13&14 For we do now trite you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that, as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.

* Essential Community Presentation at the arrival of the Lord.

# Mastering Followership
[[Oronde Smith]]

# Why is this Important Now?

## Statement 1
> In this season of Fortress Building, the Congress has been given patterns discovered by the Creative core.


Acts 7:44 BSB
> Our fathers had the tabernacle of the Testimony with them in the wilderness. It was constructed exactly as God had directed Moses, according to the the pattern he had seen

## Statement 2
> One of the last day strategies of the darkness is deception, because deception is rampant, we need sight of a clear pathway that we can walk that keeps us 'safe'.

We must have leadership that provides a Lifestyle Pattern that 'leads' to Christ.
The pattern must be aligned to the principles of the Word of God.

2 Timothy 3:1-2 NKJV

2 Timothy 3:10-11 NKJV
> But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance.

2 Timothy 3:13-14 NKJV

## Statement 3
> As we approach the Finish and our proclamation of maturity intensifies, we must master fundamental aspects of our Faith.
* The first instruction to the disciples - follow me

Matthew 4: 18-20
# The power of Followership

Gideon's defeat of the Midianites.

Context - Judges 6:

_Israel has been oppressed for 7 years by Midian._  
_God calls Gideon and initiates a process that moves him from fear, doubt and weakness to strength, confidence and capability._  
_Gideon grows into becoming a CORE structure and the activation point for the Lord's purpose in the nation._  

Judges 7:
The limitation imposed by God was designed into the process to amplify His role.

Judges 7:7-8 NIV
Judges 7:13-14 
Judges 7:19-20

The activating reality is the ability of the people to follow _exactly_.

| Gideon Represents                                               | The 300 Represent                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A mature pattern of Growth Transformation & Development         | God's selection of an Expanded Core in synchronization with Leadership |
| A Core that becomes the activation point for the Lord's Purpose | An Expanded Core totally committed to the Mission                      |
| The Power to Finish the Lord's Mission                          | Capacity to Exactly Follow Leadership                                  |

Together, they represent:
A Mature Kingdom Community:
* Mature Leadership built by the Lord walking alongside committed Followership
* Clear presentation of patterns AND the capacity to perceive and follow those patterns.
 
# Principles of Followership

Jesus and the Disciples.

Early strategic activity of Jesus involved calling the disciples. The establishment of a team.
A team built from various walks of life.


* If any wants to follow, let him deny himself
