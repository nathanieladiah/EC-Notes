#ECCG

The common theme is separation of the current images:
* Tare and wheat
* Good fish and bad fish
* Spacesuit

The call to stand where God is is a call to a process of clear separation between: 
* What is of the world and what is of the Kingdom
	* The world is masquerading as the Kingdom, and there is the possibility of deception.
* What is condemned unto destruction and what is ordained unto eternal life.


## The Issue of Separation and Judgment

Revelation 18:4-5

The language implies that time is short.

### An Important Distinction

When we speak of judgment as it relates to the Body of Christ, we are speaking of judgment that is intended to lead to maturity in Christ and NOT destruction.

During the Last Plague, the judgment of the Lord came upon all who dwelt in the land of Egypt.

- Exodus 12:12
- There were requirements that was expected of all

For Egypt, judgment led to the destruction of their empire and way of life

But for Israel, judgment set them free to come to Him.

## Can we hear and do we obey?

Darkness to one, light to another.

The judgment of the Lord is not to be feared and shied away from, but rather embraced with hope, expectancy and joy of being made ready for departure.

Our process of separation must not be driven by human sight but by sight iparted by the Holy Spirit

- Separation is a function of spiritual sight

- A good cry is to ask for open eyes.

The judgment of the Lord delivers this spiritual sight and enables an accurate process of separation.

The Churches in the Book of Revelation

Revelation 2& 3 detail the Lord's judgment and evaluation of each of the seven churches.

In each case the Lord ends His evaluative interaction with the encouragement to "overcome" and gives a hope-filled  promise.

Judgment: Encouragement & Hope

2:7 - Ephesus - To Him who overcomes I will give to eat from the tree of life…

2:26

3:5 - He who overcomes sha

3:12 - He who overcomes, I will make a pillar in the temple of My God

3:21 - To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My throne…

The message here is clear

- A correct response to Divine judgment leads to mercy, redemption and everlasting reward
- Overcoming (the things the Lord points out) is linked to rewards
- Don't look at what must be overcome! Instead, fix your gaze upon the value that lies beyond it!

## The Process of Judgment

A judgment is a final opinion or decision on a matter or dispute given by someone of recognized authority.

Judgment points the way forward by clarifying and separating entangled issues.

The judgment of the Lord does not simply direct us what to do but also makes us wiser for a more stable and secure movement forward.

The process of the Lord's judgment sharpens our sense of separation and distinction between what is of the Lord from what is not.

2 Corinthians 6:14-18
