He promises to provide everything we need for _today_ and that each day will have its own provision! (Matthew 6:11)
- Just like the manna for the Israelites
- Our job is to discover His preferences and implement them on the earth.


We have numerous legitimate concerns produced by mortal life and systemic collapse.

Our source of life is the flow of constant speaking from the Father. It is the nourishment to our souls.

We want to feel on a deep spiritual level, a connection to the whole body of Christ.

Deuteronomy 32:3-4
> I will proclaim the nam eo fthe Lord. Oh, praise the greatness of our God!
> He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he.

Psalms 89:14
> Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; love and faithfulness go before you.

Isaiah 61:8-9
> "For I, the Lord, love justice; I hate robbery and wrongdoing. In my faithfulness I will reward my people and make an everlasting covenant with them. 
> Their descendants will be known among the nations and their offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge that they are a people the Lord has blessed."

Romans 2:6
> God "will repay each person according to what they have done."

1 Kings 21
2 Kings 9:22-26
> The account of Naboth

* This situation violated a cornerstone of social justice in Israel - how property is assigned
* ...
* Ahab's response did mitigate the strength of God's reaction


Romans 8:18-19
> I **_consider_** that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. 
> For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.

* We are not assured of justice/resolution in this life but we convert injustice that we experience here into eternal value.


A Father who is **resolutely just** puts this into the substructure of our FAITH:
- Recognition that situations of injustice in mortality are producing great value in our lives and families so we **don't search** for resolution here.
- Dignity and assurance as we walk through the injustices of this age, knowing that He is sorting everything out in the end!

Matthew 18:10-14

The package of redemption does include help from Our Father when we are persecuted, victimized or unjustly treated by other people.
