# Entering the _In Christ_ State of Life

Colossians 3:3
> For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.

_Died_ means rejection of independent and self-determined living.
We are 100% in. He is fully our master.
There's no future or hopes or dreams that excite a dead person.

_Hidden_ implies that we have been wrapped up in something much bigger than ourselves.
This is a safe place for us, no need for independence and self-preference.

Galatians 2:20 NLT
> My old self has been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. So I live in this earthly body by trusting (faith) in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

## Entering the In Christ State of Life

Galatians 3:26-28 NLT
> For you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus. And all who have been united with Christ in baptism have put on Christ, like putting on new clothes. There is no longer Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male and female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.

Our sense of identity is totally redefined in the Christ state of life

This defines everything about who we are!

John 5:19-20
