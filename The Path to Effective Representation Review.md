Amos 6:1, 3-6
### A cry for the Body

**Affliction** - shattering of a wall; breaking of a foot; disruption of a dream.
**Grieved** - heart-sickness about a situation that drives the making of an entreaty.

The scriptures give precise and clear definition for the architecture of an accurate God-designed human life here at the end of Time:
* An involved, connected and well-directed life that does not take its definers from the standards of this world.
* A life that is not self-indulgent but it is focused on the Finish and is not undermined by the seductive comforts and false values of this deceptive world.
* A life that yearns after the safety, security and spiritual health of the Body of Christ.
### Looking at Jesus

Ephesians 4:13
We need to grow into the characteristics that define Christ.

Matthew 17:4-5
* The insignificant man IS the Beloved Son
* The unknown 

Matthew 11:28
The viewpoint from the Upper Realm is completely different from the earth's viewpoint.

Romans 3:22-24


### Becoming Aware

A process took place in the life of the young man Jesus
* Determined efforts to discover the meaning of the Mission - Luke 2:49
* Wrestled with divine development in difficult life situation Hebrews 5:8 (Learned obedience from what he suffered.)
* Engaged in step-by-step progressive development in all areas of his life - Luke 2: 51-52 (hew went to Nazareth and was obedient to them ... and grew in wisdom, stature and in favor with God and man)
* He fought hard in the Spirit for enlightenment and for life falling upon him from heaven - Hebrews 5: 7 
	* This too is a significant part of the Christ nature and the Christ reality and we must be like him. 
	* we must come to the "full measure of the stature of Christ!" (Ephesians 4:13)
	* We cannot treat with passivity and laziness


### From One man to All

* 2 Corinthians 5:14-15
* Ephesians 3:16-21
* Colossians 1:15, 19-20
* Colossians 2:9-14
* Hebrews 12:22-24


### What do we Recognize?

That though we are not powerful and significant in the way in which the earth sees and recognizes power that we have received a massive impartation of true and correct identity given to us by the everlasting Upper Realm.

That we have received a heart-cry from God as one, as unified and as inseparable.

We cannot receive if the Body has not received! We cannot hear if the Body has not heard! We cannot move if the Body has not moved.

1 Corinthians 12:12-13
Ephesians 4:4-6

The revealing of the truth of the Highway to Zion was not given to us just for us. 

We must walk the Highway in full representational power of a whole unified Body of Christ and this is what we proclaim before the Lord.
