Psalm 50: 1-5; 23
Psalm 97


[[Ernest King]]

A Day of Finalization

A day in which:
* The invisible attributes, tricks and schemes of the enemy are being exposed & stripped of their deceptive power
* God's people are being equipped with the sight, skill & courage to walk through the final onslaught of Darkness on the way to the Finish

Luke 22: 31-34

Sift (siniao) - to winnow, prove by trials; inward agitation to try one's faith to the verge of overthrow.


Unveiling of Satanic Intent
* Provides access to the sight of the unfolding events from the perspective of the Upper Realm
* Facilitates synchronization in the earth with the governing will & intent of Heaven.
* Is intended to rob the enemy of the power to intimidate through the threat of destruction
* Is designed to produce a correct response to judgment.
	* We yield to correction and judgment.
	* When God points out things, it indicates that He is ready to provide help to allow for change.
* Releases prophetic guardrails within which to hear the voice of God & guide the mission to completion.


## Shift in focus & priority - from the threat of Darkness to the governing power of Light

The Upper Realm is in directive control of the process throughout the assault of Darkness.

The wisdom & skill to prevail against the plans of the enemy are assured, if we walk in faith & remain true to HIs Word/Ways.


## Sifting is approved activity & a powerful expression of Divine confidence.

God is looking at us and allowing us to be tested. 

It is intended to test the 'faith quality' of  the totality of the Christ structure - Jesus & His disciples.

Faith to prevail is available in the day of testing

## Human confidence is insufficient to withstand the scrutiny of Darkness

Testing exposes the limitation of human confidence masquerading as firm conviction

It activates to forge resolution or finalized faith - one that transcends the fear of loss & is rooted in the excellence of the knowledge of Christ (Philippians 3:7-14)

Finalized faith is the prize at the end of the process of testing.


## Existence of human deficiency in no way erodes Divine confidence

In a day of judgment, deficiency does not mean disqualification.
* It's just a sign to change
* they will be made clear by circumstances approved by God

It is not a time to be hobbled by sight of that which is yet to be perfected - either in ourselves or others
* Offer forgiveness as much as we need forgiveness.

It's a time to be fully resolved regarding the redemptive power of Christ's salvation!

Looking At Christ

He IS the Highway

John 14:6 - Jesus said to him, "I am the WAY, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me."

Therefore, the process on the Highway is to be "conformed" to Christ.

Romans 8:29
"Predestined" - a future that someone **will** have. It suggests that the future has been decide or planned by God.

This fills us with confidence, faith, responsibility...

Hebrews 12:2

# Jesus: Resolute in the Face of Resistance

Luke 4:1-13

1. Resistance does not mean that you are outside of the will of God.
	* Things can turn unexpectedly, but that doesn't mean we are outside
	* Jesus was led by Spirit.
	* Acts 14:22
	
2. Circumstances (external to us) are probing to find weakness within our internal structures.
	* ...he ate nothing during those days and at the end of them he was hungry
	* a direct appeal to the self-life to assume control and responsibility for the outcomes of life (...if you are the Son of God)
	* John 14:30

The self is the primary source of resistance that Satan has targeted since the beginning.

To ignore the 'perception set' provided by the speaking of God and depend upon self-perception is to enter into death.

If responded to correctly the resistance can be 'used' to identify points of development and growth - we must not hide!
* allows us to change.


* Get past self deception and refusal to look at or consider yourself
* stop the self-indulgence
* stop lie-ing to yourself
* stop trying to survive through a supportive earthly self-concept and fall with deep trust into the Lord through His spirit.



3. The antidote, the holy grail, the only solution, is the Word of God

	* All Christ said was "It is Written"

	* We must have minds full of Light and hearts full of the Living Word of the Lord

	* Psalm 119:
		* 9 - How can a young person stay on the path of purity? By living according to your word
		* 105 - You word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.
		* 130 - The unfolding of your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.
	
	* Hebrews 4:12

	* James 1:21

	* Psalm 130:5



## Resolution, the Word of God & the Final Challenge

Matthew 27:39-40, 46
Psalm 22

God is confronting the cracks in order to fix us.

He is fixing the cracks and telling us to experience the fix.
The fix of God is aligning us to the standards of the Upper Realm.

Our internal life is entirely designed by God and guided by light.
