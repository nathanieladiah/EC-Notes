Exodus 1:7-14

> 7 but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them.
> 
> 8 Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt. 9 “Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous for us. 10 Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.”
> 
> 11 So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labour, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. 12 But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites 13 and worked them ruthlessly. 14 They made their lives bitter with harsh labour in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their harsh labour the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly.

**What is the increase?**

* Greater perception of the upper realm
* Strong strategic alliances with forces that come from above to smash the systems

## The Power of Inner Certainty

Genesis 50:24-25
> 24 Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.” 25 And Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath and said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.”

Genesis 49:22-26

> 22 “Joseph is a fruitful vine,  
    a fruitful vine near a spring,  
    whose branches climb over a wall.
23 With bitterness archers attacked him;  
    they shot at him with hostility.  
24 But his bow remained steady,  
    his strong arms stayed limber,  
because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob,  
    because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,  
25 because of your father’s God, who helps you,  
    because of the Almighty, who blesses you  
with blessings of the skies above,  
    blessings of the deep springs below,  
    blessings of the breast and womb.  
26 Your father’s blessings are greater  
    than the blessings of the ancient mountains,  
    than the bounty of the age-old hills.  
Let all these rest on the head of Joseph,  
    on the brow of the prince among his brothers.

## Complex Community Involvement

Plague 10
Exodus 11

The previous plagues had a single direct earthly actor involved. Now there's a strong emphasis on community acting.

Community obedience is now joined to divine action.
