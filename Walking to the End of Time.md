The importance of the Word of God as a core structure in the life of a believer.

## God, the Master Strategist

Our church was built on a foundation of prophetic faith.

We see it with the structure like GCT and Growth Groups that allowed us to survive during the current crises.

## What is God's intent?

As we move further and deeper into the purposes of God, we know, we know the darkness gets deeper.

_Hebrews 12:26_
> 26 His voice shook the earth at that time, but now He has promised, Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven.

1. Behind the apparent chaos and confusion is God the strategist. He is allowing all things to occur.

	* The events are designed to produce a clear distinction
	
2. Only that which is unshakable will remain. _1 Peter 1:23-25_
	* Only a life built upon the word of God will have the capacity to endure the coming crisis and partner with God to move his purposes to the end of time.

## The Pattern of Christ

_John 1:1, 14_
> 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

> 14 The Word became flesh and took up residence among us. We observed His glory, the glory as the •One and Only  Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.

The word of God will endure forever.
Christ's life was built upon the word of God.

Christ triumphed over the last enemy because his life was completely word-based.

The future is full of darkness and deception.

_Psalm 119:105_
> Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.
* This verse is first an internal posture

_John 8:31_
> To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.

_John 7:17_
> Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.

_Psalms 119:11_
> I have hidden your word in my heart  
    that I might not sin against you.

How does this really work?

Familiarity with the Word and the embedding of it within our hearts creates an intuitive and heightened level of discernment that allows us to distinguish right from wrong.

## Practical Application

_Proverbs 7_

_Colossians 3:2_
> Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.

_Psalms 34:7_
> The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him,  
    and he delivers them.

## The Word of God and Renewal

It is only God that can change us

_Romans 10:17_
> Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ.

The Word of God is divine energy with creative power, not just words on a page.

_Genesis 1_

God does not enforce His will. He always desires partnership.
The Word of God is an arbiter and a judge.

The word of God is presented as a mirror

_2 Corinthians 3:18_
> And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.

_James 1:23_
> Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror

This allows us to see where we are and where God wants us to be. We can see the gap.

## The Power of Proclamation

_Proverbs 18:21_
> The tongue has the power of life and death,  
    and those who love it will eat its fruit.

_Romans 10:9_
> If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
