## Audio
* Lights backstage stay on until 10 minutes before service.
* Neaten up backstage to ensure no trip hazards
* Change mic receiver for handheld 1 (To be confirmed with Jason)
* Mics picking up sound -> feedback on stage.
	* Mics should be muted when not in use (band)


Auditorium lights - flickering.

## Video Directing

Daniel Li
> Getting the equipment was not entirely smooth. Every day there would have been new requirements from the leaders. 
> Example - adding on some more speakers (Thursday)
> Set up was relatively easy. But dynamic - additional board added on the fly (Needed more outputs for the band).
> Additional monitors on the second day - required coming back to the building for equipment.

Learning outcome
> Know the equipment more. You need to know how things work as opposed to just plug and play at the building.

Javan
> Issues with mics not working. A mix up with the connections? Mix up with language - 4 speakers not 2 speakers and 2 monitors


Shadell
> Feedback.
> Communication in terms of required personnel -> getting dedicated runners for mics
> So that those online could get the same experience

Clarify the communications in terms of requirements from the leaders (runners).

Christina
>Left with a better grasp of the equipment. Bonding experience.


Check handheld 3 to determine what the issue is.
* Lapel 3

Recording for external meetings through the board (to be rectified)

Follow up on UI16 SoundCraft currently in storage room.

Tool for testing cables and power on the day.

### Networking 
- need to have our own internet.
- Uploads too slow - asset management
- Especially for Victory Heights


### Video Directing
Understanding the equipment - signal flow, decimators etc.

More training in general - routing etc. to know what's possible
