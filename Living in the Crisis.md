Crises in the earth is only going to increase.

There is intense spiritual activity in the heavens.

Exodus 1:6-12

> 6 Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died, 7 but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them.
>
>8 Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt. 9 “Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous for us. 10 Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.”
>
> 11 So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labour, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. 12 But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites

## The intent of darkness

2 Peter 3:3-4

> 3 Above all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. 4 They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he promised? Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.”

* To oppress the people of God that it breaks their spirit and destroys their faith.

Exodus 6:9

> Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and harsh labour.

* To create fear and anxiety

* To break community, create fragmentation and division and enforce the priority of self-interest.
