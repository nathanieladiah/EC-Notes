James 1:1-8 (NIV/NLT)

> 1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations - Greetings!

One nation with one character, purpose, desire, and destiny - one salvation - but in different geographic places.

* At the time, he was talking to those, not actually in the geographical location - this is a picture of EC - one people scattered across many different countries.
* Also a representation of the whole Body of Christ.

This structure has different parts which make up one body which God has desired and designed ... like us
All 12 tribes also represent the fullness, the completion, of the people of God.


> 2 Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds,

This is of course, not a natural response. 

_'Trials of many kinds'_ describes a situation of multiple and various trials, often occurring simultaneously, that surround and want to engulf or drown us.

He's saying the first reaction is to consider this 'pure joy'

(Note: We don't seek out trials; nor do we passively accept every kind of trial as joy)

The word 'consider' or 'count' is _hegomai_ (to lead the way) 

Paul uses this word in Philippians 3, where he talks about what he used to value before he knew Christ, and what he valued after he met Christ.

> 3 For you know that when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow.
> 
> 4 Let this endurance complete its work so that you may be fully mature, complete, and lacking in nothing

Fully mature is what is needed for the End to come

* Ephesians 4:13
	*  ...until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.

A key component of maturity and also a quality that will lead to it, is endurance, or perseverance.

Endurance is a combination of courage and patience over a long time.

Romans 5:3-5
> 3 We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help us develop endurance
> 4 And endurance develops strength of character and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation. 6 And this hope will not lead to disappointment...

Character - _dokime_ tested and approved to be goo

Romans 15:4-5 NIV

Along with endurance God will give us encouragement.
Endurance maintains our hope
Endurance will make us fully mature.
'Fully mature' is required for the finish


James then (apparently) changes the subject 
NIV

> 5 "If any of you lacks" wisdom ("if you need wisdom" NLT), you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you."

Why does James use _"If"_?

This implies that you may know already what to do...

This seems like a general question until you look more closely. It cannot be in a general context because of the word 'if'.
It must be specific to this situation:
* It is in the context of the trials that James is encouraging us to ask God for wisdom

However he warns that there is something that can block the flow of wisdom coming to us, and it's mentioned particularly in this context.

> 6 Let him ask in faith, not vacillating (or wavering) at all. For an indecisive person resembles the wind-swept surf of the sea, tossing up and down.
> 7 That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.
> 8 Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do.

Double-minded - literally 'double-souled'

The soul involves our emotions and desires as well as our mind
In this case it involves our attitude to God and deciding whether we trust Him.

Sometimes faith is required to accept wisdom... because what God tells you:
* may appear to have nothing to do with the trial
* makes no sense to our natural mind
* is totally opposite to the thinking of the world
* may appear impossible naturally
* is not the solution you wanted
* requires us to refuse to believe our fears

Jeremiah 38:17-20 NIV
> 17 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "This is what the Lord God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down; you and your family will live"
> 18 But if you will not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians and they will burn it down; you yourself will not escape from them.'"
> 19 King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the Jews who have gone over to the Babylonians, for the Babylonians my hand me over to them.."
> 20 "They will not hand you over," Jeremiah replied. "Obey the Lord by doing what I tell you. Then it will go well with you, and your life will be spared."

Sometimes people vacillate because they want God to do things their way instead of His way.
Or they think, rightly or wrongly, that doing what God is telling them to do will involve giving up things they want to hold onto.

Or sometimes it's a deception of the enemy telling you God doesn't want the best for you.
To keep on seeking for advice or wisdom when God has made very clear what he is saying, is a refusal to trust God.

## Faith vs Wavering

The opposite of faith in this context is not a denial that God exists, but vacillation - refusing to accept what God says, neither obeying his commands, nor heeding his warnings, nor believing his promises.\

If you genuinely take a position to obey God, to believe in advance what he tells you to do, he won't keep reproaching you about past failure - he will say, let's make a new start, leg's take it from here.

> 9 Believers in humble circumstances ought to take pride in their high position
> 10 But the rich 
> 11 For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich will fade away even while they go about their business.

What is the right attitude in both cases?
Simply that this world with its values is very temporary.

We cannot be entice by, pre-occupied with, put in first place, or be pursuing the values of the world if we are to successfully receive wisdom from God and if we are to endure through trials.
We are not unaware of this realm, but we have to be more aware of the Upper Realm

God's purpose for us may or may not involve obvious or major outward success, but that must not be our first priority.
Job's standing in the spirit realm was not dependent upon his outward skill and success.
* His success was in his character - God boasted of Job's integrity

> 12 Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.
* This is the total contrast to this mortal temporary realm.

## Enduring Trials

Enduring trials is a part of loving God.

Enduring trials is part of our faith in God. It involves:
* Believing that the next realm is both real and eternal.
* believing his promise that there is reward there for what we have done here.

> 13 And remember, when you are being tempted, do not say, "God is tempting me." God is never tempted to do wrong, and he never tempts anyone else.
* Here is a sudden contrast - James alerts to a possible danger when under trials - getting resentful against God.
* That is an immature attitude against God

In contrast to what has gone before, the exhortation to endurance

> 14 Temptation comes from our own desires, which entice us and drag us away.
> 15 These desires give birth to sinful actions. And when sin is allowed to grow, it gives birth to death.
* Don't give way to resentment against God

An aspect of trials is that sometimes the enemy can use them to tempt you to get out of the trial by taking a short cut that God doesn't want.

'Sin' can be actual wrong-doing or just missing the mark.

## Relevant Questions

Are we ourselves, or God, in control of our lives?
* God is in charge of everything; He is Sovereign, He does whatever He pleases
* However we are also responsible for our lives

The course and outcome of our lives depends upon God but also upon us - our choices, our decisions...

If we please God in these things then he will do things in and through us far beyond all that we could have asked or thought.

At the core, we must have a right view of God; He always wants the best for us

"Don't be deceived". (James 1:16)

* Never say that God is responsible for any temptation to sin involved in a trial
* Refuse the temptation to give up, to stop persevering, to no longer endure
* Refuse any opportunity to take an unapproved exit from the situation.


> 17 Every good and perfect fight is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.
> 18 He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of first-fruits of all he created.

God is absolutely constant, reliable
He delights to give us good things. We are the first fruits of his creation
* The best of the crop
* Belongs to God
