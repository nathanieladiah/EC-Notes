Deuteronomy 6:20-25
* A powerful spirit of enquiry should be part of our current context.
* _"He brought us out to bring us in"_

* In the future (_which is now our current present on the Highway to Zion_) a spirit of enquiry will descend and the people then will begin to "ask".
* Current meaning is connected to historical understanding.
* The 'laws' that determine behaviour in the present can only be obeyed if we track patterns that are embedded in the historical experience.
* **Success** involves total accuracy in the present and powerful investment in the patterns that created the journey.
