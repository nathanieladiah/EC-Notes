#ECCG

Every person in the past who has obeyed God has contributed towards the Finish and all will receive a reward.
However there must be a final generation at some point.

What is our spiritual stance, posture and determination?
What are the challenges?
What are our resources?

Psalm 110:1
- God allows David to hear and understand a declaration spoken in the Upper Realm that is normally unavailable to human ears.
- It determines the eternal future of the universe, time, the principalities and powers, humans and Christ himself.
- God not only allowed David to hear it, but told him to write it down so that the everyone can know.
- David refers to two Lords ('the' Lord and 'my' lord) both of which are his lords.
	- 'Lord' is the word 'Yahweh', which refers to God i.e. God the Father
	- Who is 'my lord'? - the general word for a king or ruler. But David was the king, he had no-one over him.
	* Therefore this second person has to be someone in the heavens also. This has to be the Son of God, who would be born into the human race and named Jesus.

What does David hear? - "Sit at my right hand" - the place of trust, privilege, partnership, authority, power - 
"until I make your enemies your footstool".
- Until implies an end point, a completion, a fulfilment of a promise and process

Ephesians 2:6

This is the background to our advance into the final purposes of God at the end of times.

It is the irrevocable declaration of God that determines the end.

Acts 2:33-35
Peter is speaking at the very beginning

Psalm 110:5-6

## The War

Obviously Satan wants to stop our advance - he has a lot of strategies, but his ultimate defeat is already determined and certain.

If we fight according to Christ's orders and guidance, we will win.

We need to hear from the Holy Spirit in every particular situation, but we can consider some general principles from scripture.

1. Remember that we don't fight in the flesh. Hear from the Holy Spirit.
2. Do NOT be spiritually passive.
3. Having said that, sometimes you need to choose your battles.
4. Be alert, but not paranoid.
5. Don't assume that the strategy/stance required for this battle is the same as for a previous one - inquire from God every time.

What are some of Satan's strategies:

1. Satan will try to attack our identity - "if you are..."
	- Satan's main attack is to get us to doubt what God has said, and ultimately to doubt God's character and love for us.
	- A variant of this is, "If you were..." (e.g. this wouldn't have happened)
	- A defence to many of these kinds of attacks is to realize that it is Satan speaking.

2.  Teaching from a counterfeit/corrupted church
	* Matthew 16:1-4

3. Our flesh and natural thinking will try to keep us absorbed and preoccupied with the natural, physical things of this life
	* Matthew 16:5-12
	* Keep your first focus on the invisible

4. We can be pulled into dream-spasms - ideas and fantasies about ourselves and our future that are unrealistic, foolish, and are just irrelevant.

5. Satan and/or our flesh can tempt us with deliberate sin - to do something we know is wrong but seems so attractive in the moment. (David & Bathsheba)

6. Being off-balance in 'spiritual' things. 
	* The Bible indicates God's priorities and preferences, as well as direct commands.

7. We can also get a wrong balance on all kinds of natural things, e.g. food, health, exercise, finances.
	* We don't want to neglect an essential part of our life, but neither get it out of proportion. One of the world's traps is to over-emphasize the good things.
