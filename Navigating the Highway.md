2 Kings 2:1-18 - Elijah & Elisha

> Elijah at the end of his journey and being taken up into heaven.

1. Proximity
	* 2 Kings 2:7 - They stood at a distance
	* There is a distinction between Elisha who is closely following and refuses to be separated.
	* This is a relational time as we're walking down the highway.
	* "Stand in the place where God is!"

2. Knowledge vs Lifestyle
	* 2 Kings 2:5
	* Pharisees "know" but they do not "do".
	* The 8-lane highway is the architecture of our inner man - not knowledge of some principles.
		* We're not memorizing the principles, but we are letting them define our lives right now.
		* Personally applying these principles in our lives practically.

3. Intensifying our Commitment
	* Elisha is tested when Elijah tells him to stay back and stop following.
	* It happened 3 times, indicating a progressive and incremental increase in commitment not to turn aside.
	* Nothing in the world is our main focus

4. Sight of the Finish
	* 2 Kings 2:10 
	* Our sight of the Finish has increased progressively until it is right before us

5. Representation
	* The sons of the prophets sent out a search party even though:
	  1. Elisha said it would do no good.
	  2. They themselves said Elijah would be taken away.
	  * The wider BoC has some awareness that we are living in apocalyptic times, but it doesn't produce insight and activity that is Finish oriented.
	  * There must be an Elisha dimension with clarity and insight into god's present location that stands on behalf of

## Paul's Journey

Prophetic Inputs

1. The Holy Spirit warns in every city that bonds and afflictions await.
2. Disciples at Tyre prophesy Paul should not go.
3. Agabus predicted arrest and prison.


Other inputs
* Contradictory "words" from others
* Concern for what is to come
* Paul's team begged him not to go

"If only I might Finish the race!"
- Sight of the Finish resolves confusion and dismisses competing claims.


Personal Agreement with the Will of God.
* Acts 20:22

Under Divine Law
* Because we are the Finishing generation, some options for life are off limits.
* We are bound by the requirement for personal finalized maturity - it is the law that rules
* It's illegal to coast, or to engage in avoidance of issues


Dealing with Self
Acts 20:24
"I consider my life worth nothing to me"

The only value my life really has is to complete God's purpose.
