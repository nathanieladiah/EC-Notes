#ECCG

There's a sudden shift of the earth and human life.

Romans 8:22-23
* The pains of childbirth indicate that something new is coming into being.

What has changed?
The breakdown of human society and the human heart is matched by the Lord.
We are focusing not on the bad news, and the negative but what is coming into being. Our identity depends on the call of God, not on our physical geographical placement.

Facilitation is making something possible or easier. The act of assisting or the improvement of something. Active serving of the needs of any group.

Spiritual transition from what we were to what God needs us to be.
Facilitation requires a definite attitude of 'standing alongside'


New structure based on:
* Personal input and care
* Standing alongside
* Empowerment and elevation of the SEs within the congress
* Transfer of life through brotherhood and mutual support.

New architecture is based on the Growth Group principle:
* Closeness of relationship
* Active sharing of life
* Dynamic mutual support
* Coordination and encouragement among peers
* Working out and following of the apostolic journey of the Congress within small socially connected groups

This structure promotes life when things are falling apart. Support and connectedness as isolation and fragmentation enters the earth.

Spiritual, psychological and emotional support and real companionship as the world tears itself apart.

Speed of transmission of apostolic directives and capability for increasingly rapid response from the Congress.

## Two Massive Emphases

1. Elevation of SEs into real practical partnership and standing alongside the Apostolic Grace as Authentic Builders of the Congress.
2. The high-priority Divine Demand that the saints must be matured. Saints must be empowered to carry the burden movement to the End of Time

Ephesians 4:11-13

Luke 18:22
