# Considering the History

Every time God moves, there is something that needs to change. More things to be aware of.

The nature of the journey we have been on: No-one is here accidentally, everyone was selected by God to be here.
There is therefore responsibility to honour the fact of this selection.


We are on the Highway...
What is our initial response?

To be authentic, we must embrace each of these lanes and keep them in our heart.
* We must sit and consider each of these lanes.

Being an active listener - shooting up arrow prayers during the meeting. Actually processing with the message.

The word of God is spirit and life.


The concept of the highway assumes built-in guard rails so Step 1 to acceptable functionality is vigorous and acceptable spirituality in each of you.
We must all walk within the guardrails set aside for us from God - a new concept of a life that has to function within the guardrails.

Freedom is the freedom to walk inside the boundaries of God. Outside the boundary, there is darkness.

Everything about our Congress is an act of war. Even doing the mundane things well and accurately are considered acts of war against the enemy.
