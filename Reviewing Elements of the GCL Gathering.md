_Joel 3:11-16_
> Come quickly, all you nations everywhere. gather together in the valley. And now, O LORD, call out your warriors!
>
> "Let the nations be called to arms. Let them march to the valley of Jehoshaphat. There I, the LORD, will sit to pronounce judgment on them all."
>
 >Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come tread the grapes, for the winepress is full. The storage vats are overflowing with the wickedness of these people."
> ...
> The sun and moon will grow dark, and the stars will no longer shine.
>
> The LORD's voice will roar from ZION and thunder from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth wills hake. But the LORD will be a refuge for his people, a strong fortress for the people of Israel.


Jehoshaphat means 'God will Judge'.
* This valley represents a time, season and spiritual reality of the Judgement of the Lord.
* This is the season we are now in.
	* Chaos is taking place all around, but He is taking us above the chaos.
	
## Defining the "Roar" for Us!

### The absolute deluge of spiritual resource falling upon us from the Upper Realm.

We don't want to miss anything. We must be tuned into the frequencies to know this is the time to interact with the word of God.

* A deluge: derived from an original word meaning - A Flood
* Implies that waters overwhelm you and flow over your head
* Referencing _Ezekiel 47:1-5_

When God is calling the nations to judgement, this is our example:

> 1. Then he brought me back to the door of the temple; and there was water, flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east, for the front of the temple faced east; the water was flowing from under the right side of the temple, south of the altar.
> 2. He brought me out by the way of the north gate, and led me around on the outside to the outer gateway that faces east: and there was water, running out on the right side.
> 3. And when the man went out to the east with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the water came up to my **ankles**.
> 4. Again he measured one thousand and brought me through the waters; the water came up to my **knees**. Again he measured one thousand and brought me through; the water came up to my **waist**.
> 5. Again he measured one thousand, and it was a river that I could not cross; for the water was too deep, water in which one must swim, a river that could not be crossed.

There is a process taking place here as resource from the Lord flows down into the earth. There has to be development taking place. The grace from the Lord is increasing in awa y that requires us to have some form of growth taking place for us to receive the new. 
* Water is so deep that one MUST swim in it (self-motivation dies and the river becomes the master.)

The purpose of the River (Deluge) _Ezekiel 47:8-11_
> 9. There will be large numbers of fish, because this water flows there and makes the salt water fresh.

The deluge (forceful and emphatic release of resource) is part of the pathway to Judgment and Termination.
* Requires Correct Attitude; Precise Action; Accurate Decisions; Great Faith; Massive Hope

### Aggressive & increasingly apparent intervention
of the forces from above (both Light and Darkness) in the movement of the mortality system towards dissolution:
* No logic to the movement; breakage and shattering would be the order of the day. Landmarks removed and covenants broken; the environment of mortality is totally unsafe and uncertain.

The Roar creates both the Fortress and the Refuge (Sanctuary)
He is shaking the heavens and earth, but at the same time He is creating a strong safe place for fun.

### A signal or the period of affirmation of the impending arrival

### The nations will march

An organized process. Being called upward to the One who summoned you / it carries the notion of motion created by a summons / to ascend.

**Six Platforms:**
1. Walking within a New Season of Strength and Density
2. Finalizing & Healing all damage caused by spiritual neglect, carelessness or transgression
3. Emphatic Movement to a Pinnacle of Exactness
4. Walking in the Enemy's Craftiness: A total retreat into the Safety of Mission
5. Experiencing Spiritual Reformatting: Walking in the Spiritual Passages of Job
6. Achieving a new level of Christlikeness - "He now fills the entire sky"

## Platform 1

A season of "Strength"
* Abolition of all dimensions of personal weakness, victimhood and irrelevance.

Psalms 122:2-5

Inside the deluge is a cry from Heaven for a stronger formation of Community: Issues of the Fortress and the Core.
