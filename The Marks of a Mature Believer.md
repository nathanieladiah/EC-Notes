## 1 A Mature Believer must be a Watchman on the Walls

Isaiah 62:  6-7

The Issues of Accountability
Ezekiel 33:6

Life on earth in mortality is a mission!
The Watchman(YOU):
* Is visible and connected upwards
* Has a specific purpose and job allocated
* Is expected to perform
* Is assessed as to competence of function

Isaiah 21:6-8

The reality of a Watchman pre-supposes:
* That there IS an enemy who poses a grave danger to you.
* That you are positioned n a "high" place that facilitates Sight
	* What is a high place for me?
* That you are not distracted by the activity taking place within the city.
* Theat the enemy is in active advance towards your place of safety
* Presumes a responsibility to respond correctly.

Be fully alert!:
* Watch out for the purity of the doctrine:
	* Matthew 7:15
* Watch so you are not deceived: Matthew 24:4
* Watch and do not be confused by the times; be alert because you do not know when things will end: Matthew 25:13
* Watch out for the deception of personal greed. Your own preferences will deceive you:
	* Luke 12:15
* Watch out for the integrity of the community: Luke 17:3; Romans 16:17
* Watch out for drift in lifestyle and doctrine: 1 Timothy 4:16


## 2 A Mature Believer Must be a Coach & a Regulator of the Understanding & Culture of the community

Nehemiah 8:7=8

Flux-free..

Culture projected in community that lines up with the culture of the Upper Realm can very powerfully project spiritual resource from the Upper Realm into the realm of Mortality and Time.
* Matthew 8:5-13

## 3 A Mature Believer Guards the Divine Order of the Community and the Congress

1 Corinthians 14:40
1 Corinthians 13:33
