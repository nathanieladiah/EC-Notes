#ECCG

We are about to move forward.

The spiritual architecture:
* Everything established by the Lord has a definite form linked to functionality.
* What the Lord is building in us in order to fulfil/express/establish His Divine purpose in the earth
* Everything we do and build is according to instruction and designed to produce Divine functionality in the earth.

## Looking at the Congress

Vast and expansive. Full of diversity. Called to act as one.

Genesis 11:6
> "Look!" he said. "The people are united, and they all speak the same language. After this, nothing they set out to do will be impossible for them!"

## EC Core

The Core must be dense and strong to support expansion. If the Core breaks, then the Divine Movement will be severely compromised.

The quality of spiritual activity at the Core determines the effectiveness of the Divine movement across the Congress.
* The ripple effect: there has to be strong impact at the centre/Core.


## Moving Forward from the Knock

* The saints came to a new realization of their importance in the Congress.
* The Senior Elders were elevated as Mangers of the portal to the saints so that the Grace could flow freely to them.
* A new clothing of Maturity and commitment came over the entire Congress.
* All around us the darkness became thick and obscure as the world fell deeper into confusion, chaos and fear.

**The Cloud of God has Begun to Move Again**

## What is the Kingdom Community Architecture?

* The Approved Structure
* Guarantees the delivery of the Apostolic Grace to all the believers.

## Why must we implement?

1. The KCA builds defences in the community against the severity of the spiritual war that is raging around us
2. Creates structures that match and align with the Apostolic Grace that is flowing down to us from God.
	Exodus 25:9
	> You must build this Tabernacle and its furnishings exactly according to the pattern I will show you.
3. Massively increases the sense of integration, belonging, ownership and participation in every saint in the Kingdom Communit
4. Builds excellent organizational structure into the community that makes it easier for the Senior Elder to lead and guide community without stress...

## The Way Forward

Two things happening together:
1. Review of the KCA videos
2. Building the KCA step-by-step in all the churches.


## A Strategy from the Mind of the Lord

### The Front Guard

Numbers 10:33-36
>33 They marched for three days after leaving the mountain of the Lord, with the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant moving ahead of them to show them where to stop and rest. 34 As they moved on each day, the cloud of the Lord hovered over them. 35 And whenever the Ark set out, Moses would shout, “Arise, O Lord, and let your enemies be scattered! Let them flee before you!” 36 And when the Ark was set down, he would say, “Return, O Lord, to the countless thousands of Israel!”

* The cloud represents the Grace of the Lord that did not depart
* There was tangible evidence of the Grace
* Sense of security and guidance
* Corporate awareness of the supernatural proximity of another realm

### The Midwife Function

Exodus 1:15-22
> 15 Then Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, gave this order to the Hebrew midwives, Shiphrah and Puah: 16 “When you help the Hebrew women as they give birth, watch as they deliver. If the baby is a boy, kill him; if it is a girl, let her live.” 17 But because the midwives feared God, they refused to obey the king’s orders. They allowed the boys to live, too.
>
>18 So the king of Egypt called for the midwives. “Why have you done this?” he demanded. “Why have you allowed the boys to live?”
> 
> 19 “The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women,” the midwives replied. “They are more vigorous and have their babies so quickly that we cannot get there in time.”
> 
> 20 So God was good to the midwives, and the Israelites continued to multiply, growing more and more powerful. 21 And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.
> 
> 22 Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Throw every newborn Hebrew boy into the Nile River. But you may let the girls live.”


### Moving Forward

Not:
* Under our own guidance or power

Genesis 5:24
> 24 walking in close fellowship with God. Then one day he disappeared, because God took him.

Hebrews 11:5
> 5 It was by faith that Enoch was taken up to heaven without dying—“he disappeared, because God took him.” For before he was taken up, he was known as a person who pleased God.

Jude 1:14
> 14 Enoch, who lived in the seventh generation after Adam, prophesied about these people. He said, “Listen! The Lord is coming with countless thousands of his holy ones

* Enoch pleased God and his eyes were fixed on the Finish
* Moved in perfect coordination
* Complete partnership between his mission in the earth and the purpose of the Lord coming down from heaven
* He was synchronised with the Upper Realm.

To be in sync:
* We must all follow the instructions coming down from the Lord through the Apostolic Directives sent forward to the Congress
* We must be in perfect agreement and fellowship with each other
* We must allow the Holy Spirit to direct and guide us on every level
