# Tracking Patterns in the Life of Jesus

1. To remind ourselves of the HIghway to Zion and our responsibility to Represent the Body of Christ before God
2. To look for patterns in our icon 


The issues of Representation - from the perspective of those who walk on the Highway to Zion

Isaiah 35:8-10
> 8 And a highway will be there; it will be called the Way of Holiness; it will be for **those who walk** on that Way. The unclean will not **journey on it**; wicked fools will not **go about on it**.
> 9 No lion will be there, nor any ravenous beast; they will not be found there...


* Those who walk / Journey on it / Go about on it / Will walk there / They will enter...

This is not conceptual. An actual interfacing with something real.
There is an actual pathway/way in the spiritual realm.

The reality of the Highway was given to EC and the Congress as part of the massive fruit of our spiritual efforts in KNOCK #6

Why us? What is the Divine Intent?

Why me? - > Invisible, weak and unimportant in the scale of the world.

DNW's personal response:

> An extreme sense of humility in recognizing the awesome weight of His choice.
>
> Last time I felt this was in 1986 when He came down 
> 
> The responsibility was accompanied by a **deep sense of care** and a cry even to the point of **a distinct internal pain** for the brothers and sisters in the body of Christ.
>
> I know it is God because it is everyday. It is not sustained by deliberate emotional choice.


The highway is not designed to be walked alone. It was designed for the entire Body of Christ to come home to him.

Amos 5:1, 3-6 (NKJ)

> 1 Woe to you who are at ease in Zion and trust in Mount Samaria - notable persons in the chief nation, to whom the house of Israel comes!
> 3 Woe to you who put far off the day of doom, who cause the seat of violence to come near;
> 4 Who lie on beds of ivory, stretch out on your couches, eat lambs from the flock and calves from the midst of the stall;
> 5 Who sing idly to the sound of stringed instruments and invent for yourselves musical instruments like David;
> 6 who ...


Not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.

Not just the doctrinal aspect of Representation, but the spiritual requirement to feel for the Body of Christ.

This represents a cry in the heart for the Body of Christ.

Negatives:
* Issues of self-indulgence (at ease in Zion)
* A false faith that looks just like the real but lacks substance (Like David)
* Lack of urgency concerning the Finish (_put far off the day of doom_)
* Receiving powerful doctrine that does not cause movement in the direction of the divine interest (_eat lambs and calves_)
* Worship that never penetrates the heavens above (_sing idly_)

The scriptures give precise and clear definition for the architecture of an accurate life in the closing days of time.

* An involved, connected and well-directed life that does not take its definers from from the standards of this world.
* It is a life that is not self-indulgent but it is focused on the Finish and is not undermined by the seductive comforts and false values of this deceptive world.

We can say: 
* The Highway represents our commitment to walk in the essential nature of Christ because HE  is the WAY
* john 14;4-6

Ephesians 4:13 (NIV)

Romans 3:22-24
> 22 This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to ALL who believe

Romans 5:18

ALL: Inside the word ALL is the power of representation.

What is required is that the earthly insignificance MUST be aware of its heavenly significance.


2 Corinthians 5:14-15
Ephesians 3:16-21 (NIV)
Colossians 1:15, 19-20
Ephesians 4:4-6
