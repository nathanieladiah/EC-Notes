James 5:17

Ephesians 1:18-19

Lessons from Jacob

* To achieve transformation, we must reject the imprinting of the earth on our identity
* _Shuwb_: returning to the original wrong decision/ turn in order to correct / get on the correct path
	* Genesis 32:28 - God bringing Jacob to the original distortion that was the incorrect naming from birth.
	* This may require radical action and confrontation - Jabez
	* Must identify areas of darkness in our life, and recognize that there is new light from God that flows into our life
* Laban:
	* How much of our own life experience is an attempt by the Lord to shine a light on our lives to see our inefficiencies.
* Confronting self
	* Requires sight of God, the true standard
	* Requires the removal of blind spot
		* Matthew 7:3
		* We want a distrust of self-life. We don't want to reach the point where God has to intervene as directly as with Saul
	* Taking personal responsibility
		* Part of the "fall" - the ability to deflect blame from oneself onto others
* The Good Struggle
	* Proverbs 24:16
		* Do not allow the enemy to introduce condemnation into your life
	* Hebrews 4:16
		* It's when we struggle that we need to come boldly.
			* Dissatisfaction with current location
			* Some level of sight of a better place
			* Some level of desire for that better place
