## 6. Philadelphia Revelation 3:7-13


A massive flow of encouragement from the Lord. It's more important to be faithful, than the works we do.

His support compensates for our weakness. It helps us where we lack.

Live in the confidence of _Divine Shielding_
We have to walk through the chaos for this to activate.

## 7. Laodicea Revelation 3:14-21

Renounce complacency.
- Lack of a strong spiritual **pursuit** so there is little spiritual growth and development.

The only thing truly valuable is the life we get from the Lord.

Relationships, Purity and Sight - these arw the things we should be investing into.
