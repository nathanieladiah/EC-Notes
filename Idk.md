## 6. Philadelphia Revelation 3:7-13


A massive flow of encouragement from the Lord. It's more important to be faithful, than the works we do.

His support compensates for our weakness. It helps us where we lack.

Live in the confidence of _Divine Shielding_
We have to walk through the chaos for this to activate.
