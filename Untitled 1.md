The intent of darkness is to crush and scatter.
Our response must be different.

## Our Response: Core Truths

1. God exists. He is Sovereign and He is in complete control of unfolding events in the earth.
2. The Bible is the Word of God and is the only foundation for human existence in the earth.
3. There is a strong sense of faith, hope and conviction within our hearts and minds concerning the nature of reality and the unfolding events around us.

To be an effective believer, these 4 aspects must be congruent.
Any gaps will be exposed due to the changing nature of the arriving season and 'pressure' coming upon the earth.

## Why is Authenticity Important?

1. This is our reason for being; it is a core part of the mission
	* Genesis 1:26
	> Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness NKJV

	* If this is the mission what should our first question be?
		Who is God?


	* God gets very upset when this is violated.
		> Amos 5:21 - I hate, despise your feast days
		> Isaiah 1:13 - Your incense is detestable to me
		> Matthew 23:33 - "You snakes! You brood of vipers!"

		Jeremiah 18...


2. It is connected to the Finish

	> Ephesians 4:15


3. The danger of a fractured life in a season when God is beginning to pivot.

	*  To be fractured means you lack integrity (to be whole or to be one)
	* Everything about our life must be consistent.

	The example of Job.


4. It is a trigger for InGathering

	> Isaiah 60: 3-4 NIV
