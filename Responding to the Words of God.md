Words of God:

- Everything in the Bible
- The particular truths that God is revealing, teaching and emphasizing to us as we move towards the finish
- The specific words from God given to an individual

- A direct word from God that is not necessarily from the Bible.

Any word we get from God must be consistent with the character and truth of God; it cannot contradict a clear Biblical principle

We're focusing on the third kind…

It can come in all kinds of ways:

Mostly we know a word like this is from God because it resonates in our spirit when we hear it.

Occasionally a word can come with a sense of urgency and you need to obey immediately.

More usually we have some time to think about a word before we react.

Or a word may not require specific action, but is rather for comfort or reassurance, or perhaps adjustment or correction…

Any word we receive has the potential to bring us greater knowledge of the Lord. It brings us that much closer to Him.

Deuteronomy 32:46-47

Whatever the nature of the word, it will give us life if we accept and obey it.

God's command will always affect the future and the present.

If the word acts for correction, it's better to make small corrections now, rather than to be far off course later on in the future.

A little inaccuracy here, can end in you making a much larger mistake later on.

When we obey all of God's commands, this will affect positively the future of other people. We don't know the hidden connections.

Psalm 122:3 - closely compacted - talking about the hidden connections. Bound together.

Our understanding is linked to our obedience. If we are obedient to the words that we hear, then God will at some point tell us more. This will lead to more understanding.

If we don't understand the word that God gives us, then we can ask him to clarify it, and he will.

Matthew 21:28-31

It's not our immediate, but our long term reaction to a word that God is looking at.

The request was reasonable, and actually was in their best interests.

The flesh, and sometimes the enemy will put distractions and alterative paths in your way…

Things that are attractive, dream spasm…

The purpose of God is time-code and therefore obedience is time-dependent.

The real issue is not the command, but the obedience.

Consistent disobedience will lead to God stopping talking to you.

Luke 13:22-30

## Correct Obedience

1 Thessalonians 5:17

Matthew 6:5

Being rewarded for fulfilling one command of God depends on obeying all (as far as we have knowledge).

God doesn't expect us to know/understand everything all at once. He helps and teaches us as long as we're willing to do as he says…

A problem with Israel was not their initial lack of faith, but their persistence with that and disobedience.

James 1:19-25

We mustn't forget the word. We must find out from God all that it means, when and how to do it.

Joshua 1:7-8

The fact that God continues to talk to us is a great reassurance.
